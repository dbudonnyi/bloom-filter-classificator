SPORT

Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponentís goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.

The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861ñ1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Menís Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.

For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a midcourt shotóthe only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892, issue of the Triangle, the YMCA Training Schoolís campus paper.

While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on a 12-month basisóon summer playgrounds, in municipal, industrial, and church halls, in school yards and family driveways, and in summer campsóoften on an informal basis between two or more contestants. Many grammar schools, youth groups, municipal recreation centres, churches, and other organizations conduct basketball programs for youngsters of less than high school age. Jay Archer, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, introduced ìbiddyî basketball in 1950 for boys and girls under 12 years of age, the court and equipment being adjusted for size.

History
The early years
In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.

Since Naismith and five of his original players were Canadians, it is not surprising that Canada was the first country outside the United States to play the game. Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England in 1894, in Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.

While basketball helped swell the membership of YMCAs because of the availability of their gyms, within five years the game was outlawed by various associations because gyms that had been occupied by classes of 50 or 60 members were now monopolized by only 10 to 18 players. The banishment of the game induced many members to terminate their YMCA membership and to hire halls to play the game, thus paving the way to the professionalization of the sport.

Originally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length football trousers; jersey tights, as commonly worn by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of todayís uniforms, plus knee guards. The courts often were of irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that interfered with play. In 1903 it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In 1893 the Narragansett Machinery Co. of Providence, Rhode Island, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket. Originally a ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after a goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were adopted in 1912ñ13. In 1895ñ96 the points for making a basket (goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and the points for making a free throw (shot uncontested from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed) were reduced from three to one.

Baskets were frequently attached to balconies, making it easy for spectators behind a basket to lean over the railings and deflect the ball to favour one side and hinder the other; in 1895 teams were urged to provide a 4-by-6-foot (1.2-by-1.8-metre) screen for the purpose of eliminating interference. Soon after, wooden backboards proved more suitable. Glass backboards were legalized by the professionals in 1908ñ09 and by colleges in 1909ñ10. In 1920ñ21 the backboards were moved 2 feet (0.6 metre), and in 1939ñ40 4 feet, in from the end lines to reduce frequent stepping out-of-bounds. Fan-shaped backboards were made legal in 1940ñ41.

A soccer ball (football) was used for the first two years. In 1894 the first basketball was marketed. It was laced, measured close to 32 inches (81 cm), or about 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the soccer ball, in circumference, and weighed less than 20 ounces (567 grams). By 1948ñ49, when the laceless molded ball was made official, the size had been set at 30 inches (76 cm).

The first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) or the University of Iowa. C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in 1892. At Iowa, H.F. Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules and also presented the game to his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met Amos Alonzo Stagg, who became athletic director at the new University of Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was played between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The University of Chicago won, 15ñ12, with neither team using a substitute. Kallenberg refereed that gameóa common practice in that eraóand some of the spectators took exception to some of his decisions.

The colleges formed their own rules committee in 1905, and by 1913 there were at least five sets of rules: collegiate, YMCAñAmateur Athletic Union, those used by state militia groups, and two varieties of professional rules. Teams often agreed to play under a different set for each half of a game. To establish some measure of uniformity, the colleges, Amateur Athletic Union, and YMCA formed the Joint Rules Committee in 1915. This group was renamed the National Basketball Committee (NBC) of the United States and Canada in 1936 and until 1979 served as the gameís sole amateur rule-making body. In that year, however, the colleges broke away to form their own rules committee, and during the same year the National Federation of State High School Associations likewise assumed the task of establishing separate playing rules for the high schools. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Rules Committee for men is a 12-member board representing all three NCAA divisions. It has six members from Division I schools and three each from Divisions II and III. It has jurisdiction over colleges, junior colleges, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and Armed Forces basketball. There is a similar body for womenís play.

Growth of the game
Basketball grew steadily but slowly in popularity and importance in the United States and internationally in the first three decades after World War II. Interest in the game deepened as a result of television exposure, but with the advent of cable television, especially during the 1980s, the gameís popularity exploded at all levels. Given a timely mix of spectacular playersósuch as Earvin (ìMagicî) Johnson, Julius Erving (ìDr. Jî), Larry Bird, and Michael Jordanóand the greatly increased exposure, basketball moved quickly to the forefront of the American sporting scene, alongside such traditional leaders as baseball and football. Four areas of the game developed during this period: U.S. high school and college basketball, professional basketball, womenís basketball, and international basketball.

U.S. high school and college basketball
Basketball at the high school and college levels developed from a structured, rigid game in the early days to one that is often fast-paced and high-scoring. Individual skills improved markedly, and, although basketball continued to be regarded as the ultimate team game, individualistic, one-on-one performers came to be not only accepted but used as an effective means of winning games.

In the early years games were frequently won with point totals of less than 30, and the game, from the spectatorís viewpoint, was slow. Once a team acquired a modest lead, the popular tactic was to stall the game by passing the ball without trying to score, in an attempt to run out the clock. The NBC, seeing the need to discourage such slowdown tactics, instituted a number of rule changes. In 1932ñ33 a line was drawn at midcourt, and the offensive team was required to advance the ball past it within 10 seconds or lose possession. Five years later, in 1937ñ38, the centre jump following each field goal or free throw was eliminated. Instead, the defending team was permitted to inbound the ball from the out-of-bounds line underneath the basket. Decades passed before another alteration of like magnitude was made in the college game. After experimentation, the NCAA Rules Committee installed a 45-second shot clock in 1985 (reduced to 35 seconds in 1993), restricting the time a team could control the ball before shooting, and one year later it implemented a three-point shot rule for baskets made beyond a distance of 19.75 feet (6.0 metres). In 2008 the three-point line was moved to 20.75 feet (6.3 metres) from the basket.

More noticeable alteration in the game came at both the playing and coaching levels. Stanford Universityís Hank Luisetti was the first to use and popularize the one-hand shot in the late 1930s. Until then the only outside attempts were two-handed push shots. In the 1950s and í60s a shooting style evolved from Luisettiís push-off one hander to a jump shot, which is released at the top of the jump. West Virginia University guard Jerry West and Purdue Universityís Rick Mount were two players who demonstrated the devastating effectiveness of this shot.


Coaching strategy changed appreciably over the years. Frank W. Keaney, coach at the University of Rhode Island from 1921 to 1948, is credited with introducing the concept of ìfast breakî basketball, in which the offensive team rushes the ball upcourt hoping to get a good shot before the defense can get set. Another man who contributed to a quicker pace of play, particularly through the use of the pressure defense, was Adolph Rupp, who became the University of Kentuckyís coach in 1931 and turned its program into one of the most storied in basketball history.

Defensive coaching philosophy, similarly, has undergone change. Whereas pioneer coaches such as Henry Iba of Oklahoma A&M University (now Oklahoma State University) or Long Island Universityís Clair Bee taught strictly a man-to-man defense, the zone defense, developed by Cam Henderson of Marshall University in West Virginia, later became an integral part of the game (see below Play of the game).

Over the years one of the rules makersí chief concerns was to neutralize the advantage of taller players. At 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 metres) Joe Lapchick was considered very tall when he played for the Original Celtics in the 1920s, but, as even taller players appeared, rules were changed in response. To prevent tall players from stationing themselves near the basket, a rule was instituted in 1932ñ33 prohibiting the player with the ball from standing inside the foul lane with his back to the basket for more than three seconds; the three-second rule later applied to any attacking player in the foul lane. In 1937ñ38 a new rule forbade any player from touching the ball when it was in the basket or on its rim (basket interference), and in 1944ñ45 it became illegal for any defending player to touch the ball on its downward flight toward the basket (goaltending).

Nevertheless, with each passing decade, the teams with the tallest players tended to dominate. Bob Kurland (7 feet [2.13 metres]) led Oklahoma A&M to two NCAA championships in the 1940s and led the nation in scoring in 1945ñ46. In the same era George Mikan (6 feet 10 inches [2.08 metres]) scored more than 550 points in each of his final two seasons at DePaul University before going on to play nine professional seasons in which he scored more than 11,000 points. Mikan was an outstanding player, not only because of his size but because of his ability to shoot sweeping hook shots with both hands.

In the 1950s Bill Russell (6 feet 9 inches [2.06 metres]) led the University of San Francisco to two NCAA championships before going on to become one of the greatest centres in professional basketball history. Wilt Chamberlain (7 feet 1 inch [2.16 metres]) played at the University of Kansas before turning professional in the late 1950s and is regarded as the greatest all-around big man ever to play. It remained, however, for Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), also 7 feet 1 inch, to most influence the rules. After his sophomore year (1966ñ67) at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the dunk shot was banned from collegiate basketball, ostensibly because the rules committee felt, again, that the big men had too great an advantage. The rule was rescinded beginning with the 1976ñ77 season, and the dunk shot became an important part of the game, electrifying both fans and players.

So too have the small- and medium-size players affected the gameís development. Bob Cousy, playing at Holy Cross College and later for the Boston Celtics, was regarded as one of the gameís first great playmakers. He was among the first to use the behind-the-back pass and between-the-legs dribble as effective offensive maneuvers. Later such smaller players as Providence Collegeís Ernie DiGregorio, the University of North Carolinaís Phil Ford, and Indianaís Isiah Thomas proved the importance of their role. Between those two extremes are players such as Louisiana State Universityís Pete Maravich, who set an all-time collegiate scoring record of 44.5 points per game in the 1969ñ70 season; Magic Johnson, the point guard who led Michigan State University to a championship in 1979 and the Los Angeles Lakers to several NBA championships; Oscar Robertson, a dominating performer for the University of Cincinnati in the late 1950s and for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1970s; Larry Bird of Indiana State University, a forward of exceptional versatility who led the Boston Celtics to several championships; and Michael Jordan, a great all-around player with the University of North Carolina in the 1980s who is widely considered the best professional player in the history of the sport.

Nothing influenced the college gameís growth more than television, however. The NCAA championship games were televised nationally from 1963, and by the 1980s all three major television networks were telecasting intersectional college games during the November-to-March season. Rights fees for these games soared from a few million dollars to well over $50 million by the late 1980s. As for broadcasting the NCAA finals, a television contract that began in 2003 gave the NCAA an average of $545 million per year for the television rights; this exponential growth in broadcast fees reflected the importance of these games to both networks and advertisers.

Profits such as these inevitably attract gamblers, and in the evolution of college basketball the darkest hours have been related to gambling scandals. But, as the game began to draw more attention and generate more income, the pressure to win intensified, resulting in an outbreak of rules violations, especially with regard to recruitment of star players.

The most identifiable phase of college basketball in America is the postseason tournament held in Marchópopularly known as March Madness. Interest in the NCAA tournament paralleled the growth of the game. The first basketball tournament was staged by the Amateur Athletic Union in 1897 and was won by New York Cityís 23rd Street YMCA, later to become a traveling professional team known as the New York Wanderers. Although the YMCA was prominently identified with the game in its early years, it did not hold its first national tournament until 1923, and that event took place until 1962. The first national tournament for colleges was held in 1937 and was conducted by an organization in Kansas City, Missouri, that later became the NAIA.

New York City basketball writers organized the first National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1938, but a year later the New York City colleges took control of the event. Until the early 1950s the NIT was considered the most prestigious American tournament, but, with the growth of the college-run NCAA championship, the NIT became a consolation event for teams that failed to make the NCAA selections.

The first NCAA tournament was played in 1939, and its growth took place in three stages. The first era ran through 1964, when it was essentially a tournament for champions of various conferences. There were just eight teams in the 1939 field, and by 1963 it had been expanded to 25 teams, all champions of their respective conferences, plus several successful independent teams. The most outstanding teams of the 1940s and í50s participated in both the NCAA and NIT tournaments, but, after the gambling scandals that followed the 1950 NIT championship, a rule was passed prohibiting a team from playing in both. Afterward the NCAA tournament progressively outgrew the NIT.

In 1964 the second era dawned as the UCLA Bruins, coached by John Wooden, began a period of domination over the NCAA field. From that season until 1975 Wooden led his teams to 10 NCAA championships. Only championships won by Texas Western University (now University of Texas at El Paso) in 1966 and North Carolina State in 1974 interrupted UCLAís reign. In the eyes of many, the UCLA dynastic period probably had a regressive effect on the gameís growth; a sport with such high predictability lost some of its attractiveness.

The third growth stage came with the end of UCLAís dominance. Champions began to emerge from all sections of the country. From the field of 25 in 1974, the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 participants in 1985, to 65 in 2001, and to 68 in 2011 (corresponding ìplay-in gamesî were added in 2001 and 2011), including not only conference championship teams but other outstanding teams from the same conferences as well. Three weeks of play culminate with the Final Four weekend, an event now comparable in general public interest and media attention to the Super Bowl and World Series. Championships at the Division II, Division III, and NAIA levels also continued to grow in interest, reaping some of the fallout from the popularity of Division I.

About 17,000 high schools in the United States have basketball teams. All 50 states conduct statewide tournaments annually.

U.S. professional basketball
The professional game first prospered largely in the Middle Atlantic and New England states. Trenton (New Jersey) and the New York Wanderers were the first great professional clubs, followed by the Buffalo (New York) Germans, who started out in 1895 as 14-year-old members of the Buffalo YMCA and, with occasional new members, continued for 44 years, winning 792 out of 878 games.

A group of basketball stylists who never received the acclaim they deserved (because in their heyday they played for various towns) consisted of Edward and Lew Wachter, Jimmy Williamson, Jack Inglis, and Bill Hardman. They introduced the bounce pass and long pass as offensive weapons and championed the rule (adopted 1923ñ24) that made each player, when fouled, shoot his own free throw.

Before World War II the most widely heralded professional team was the Original Celtics, which started out in 1915 as a group of youngsters from New York City, kept adding better players in the early 1920s, and became so invincible that the team disbanded in 1928, only to regroup in the early 1930s as the New York Celtics. They finally retired in 1936. The Celtics played every night of the week, twice on Sundays, and largely on the road. During the 1922ñ23 season they won 204 of 215 games.

Another formidable aggregation was the New York Renaissance (the Rens), organized by Robert Douglas in 1923 and regarded as the strongest all-black team of all time. During the 1925ñ26 campaign they split a six-game series with the Original Celtics. During the 1932ñ33 season the Rens won 88 consecutive games. In 1939 they defeated the Harlem Globetrotters and the Oshkosh All Stars in the world championship pro tournament in Chicago. Among the great professional clubs were the teams of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and East Liverpool, Ohio, as well as the New York Nationals, the Paterson (New Jersey) Crescents, and the South Philadelphia Hebrew All Starsóbetter known as the Sphas.

The first professional league was the National Basketball League (NBL), formed in 1898. Its game differed from the college game in that a chicken-wire cage typically surrounded the court, separating players from often hostile fans. (Basketball players were long referred to as cagers.) The chicken wire was soon replaced with a rope netting, off which the players bounced like prizefighters in a boxing ring. The cage also kept the ball from going out-of-bounds, thus quickening the pace of play. In these early days players were also permitted to resume dribbling after halting. Despite the lively action of the game, the NBL and other early leagues were short-lived, mostly because of the frequent movement of players, who sold their services on a per-game basis. With players performing for several cities or clubs within the same season, the leagues suffered games of unreliable quality and many financially unstable franchises.


The Great Depression of the 1930s hurt professional basketball, and a new NBL was organized in 1937 in and around the upper Midwest. Professional basketball assumed major league status with the organization of the new Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1946 under the guidance of Walter A. Brown, president of the Boston Garden. Brown contended that professional basketball would succeed only if there were sufficient financial support to nurse the league over the early lean years, if the game emphasized skill instead of brawling, and if all players were restricted to contracts with a reserve rule protecting each team from raiding by another club. Following a costly two-year feud, the BAA and the NBL merged in 1949 to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).

To help equalize the strength of the teams, the NBA established an annual college draft permitting each club to select a college senior in inverse order to the final standings in the previous yearís competition, thus enabling the lower-standing clubs to select the more talented collegians. In addition, the game was altered through three radical rule changes in the 1954ñ55 season:

A team must shoot for a basket within 24 seconds after acquiring possession of the ball.
A bonus free throw is awarded to a player anytime the opposing team commits more than six (later five, now four) personal fouls in a quarter or more than two personal fouls in an overtime period.
Two free throws are granted for any backcourt foul.
After a struggle to survive, including some large financial losses and several short-lived franchises, the NBA took its place as the major professional basketball league in the United States. A rival 11-team American Basketball Association (ABA), with George Mikan as commissioner, was launched in the 1967ñ68 season, and a bitter feud developed with the NBA for the top collegiate talent each season. In 1976 the ABA disbanded, and four of its teams were taken into the NBA.

The NBA grew increasingly popular through the 1980s. Attendance records were broken in that decade by most of the franchises, a growth pattern stimulated at least in part by the increased coverage by cable television. The NBA has a total of 30 teams organized into Eastern and Western conferences and further divided into six divisions. In the Eastern Conference the Atlantic Division comprises the Boston Celtics, the Brooklyn Nets, the New York Knicks, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Toronto Raptors; the Central Division is made up of the Chicago Bulls, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Detroit Pistons, the Indiana Pacers, and the Milwaukee Bucks; the Southeast Division comprises the Atlanta Hawks, the Charlotte Hornets, the Miami Heat, the Orlando Magic, and the Washington Wizards. In the Western Conference the Southwest Division comprises the Texas-based Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and San Antonio Spurs, the Memphis Grizzlies, and the New Orleans Pelicans; the Northwest Division is made up of the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Utah Jazz; the Pacific Division comprises the Phoenix Suns and the California-based Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings. The play-offs follow the traditional 82-game schedule, involving 16 teams and beginning in late April. Played as a best-of-seven series, the final pairings stretch into late June.

Although basketball is traditionally a winter game, the NBA still fills its arenas and attracts a national television audience in late spring and early summer. As the popularity of the league grew, player salaries rose to an annual average of more than $5 million by mid-2000s, and some superstars earned more than $20 million yearly. The NBA has a salary cap that limits (at least theoretically, as loopholes allow many teams to exceed the cap) the total amount a team can spend on salaries in any given season.

In 2001 the NBA launched the National Basketball Development League (NBDL). The league served as a kind of ìfarm systemî for the NBA. Through its first 50 years the NBA did not have an official system of player development or a true minor league system for bringing up young and inexperienced players such as exists in major league baseball. College basketball has been the area from which the NBA did the vast majority of its recruiting. By 2000 this had begun to change somewhat, as players began to be drafted straight out of high school with increasing frequency. In 2005 the NBA instituted a rule stipulating that domestic players must be at least age 19 and have been out of high school for one year to be eligible for the draft, which in effect required players to spend at least one year in college or on an international professional team before coming to the NBA.

U.S. womenís basketball
Clara Baer, who introduced basketball at the H. Sophie Newcomb College for Women in New Orleans, influenced the womenís style of play with her set of womenís rules, published in 1895. On receiving a diagram of the court from Naismith, Baer mistook dotted lines, indicating the areas in which players might best execute team play, to be restraining lines, with the result that the forwards, centres, and guards were confined to specified areas. This seemed appropriate because many felt that the menís game was too strenuous for women.

Womenís rules over the years frequently have been modified. Until 1971 there were six players on a team, and the court was so divided that the three forwards played in the frontcourt and did all the scoring while the three guards covered the backcourt. Senda Berenson staged the first womenís college basketball game in 1893 when her freshman and sophomore Smith College women played against one another. In April 1895 the women of the University of California (Berkeley) played Stanford University. Despite a multitude of hindrances (such as being thought unladylike), womenís basketball gradually secured a foothold. In 1971, when womenís rules were changed to reduce the number on a team from six players to five and women were freed from the limits imposed by the half-court game, the level of individual skills and competition quickly rose.

In the early 1980s control of the womenís college game was shifted from the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) to the NCAA, a move that not only streamlined the operation and made it more efficient but also added to the visibility of womenís basketball. The womenís NCAA championship tournament runs concurrently with the menís, and many of the games are nationally televised. Womenís basketball became an Olympic sport in 1976.

Individual women stars have been heavily recruited by colleges, but the players frequently found that there was no opportunity for them to play beyond the college level. Leagues were occasionally formed, such as the Womenís Professional Basketball League (WPBL); begun in 1978, the WPBL lasted only three years. Eventually filling the void was the Womenís National Basketball Association (WNBA). Aligned with the powerful NBA, the WNBA held its inaugural season in 1997 with eight teams. By 2006 the WNBA had grown to 14 teams, though following the season the Charlotte Sting disbanded, and in 2008 the WNBAís inaugural champion, the Houston Comets, also folded. The Sacramento Monarchs disbanded in 2009. The Eastern Conference consists of the Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun (in Uncasville), Indiana Fever (in Indianapolis), New York Liberty (in New York City), and Washington (D.C.) Mystics. The Western Conference comprises the Los Angeles Sparks, Minnesota Lynx (in Minneapolis), Phoenix Mercury, San Antonio Silver Stars, Seattle Storm, and Tulsa (Oklahoma) Shock. Womenís professional basketball is played during the summer months.

International competition
The success of international basketball was greatly advanced by Forrest C. (ìPhogî) Allen, a Naismith disciple and a former coach at the University of Kansas, who led the movement for the inclusion of basketball in the Olympic Games in 1936 and thereafter. Basketball has also been played in the Pan-American Games since their inauguration in 1951. The international game is governed by the FÈdÈration Internationale de Basketball Amateur (FIBA). World championships began in 1950 for men and in 1953 for women. (The menís tournament was renamed the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2014.) Under international rules the court differs in that there is no frontcourt or backcourt, and the free throw lanes form a modified wedge shape. There are some differences in rules, including those governing substitutions, technical and personal fouls, free throws, intermissions, and time-outs. Outside the United States there are few places that strictly separate amateur from professional athletes.

Focus on Sports
Basketball has caught on particularly well in Italy. The Italian professional basketball league (Lega Basket) is highly regarded and popular in that country. Spain also has several basketball leagues, the main one being the ACB (AsociaciÛn de Clubes de Baloncesto). The other major centre of European basketball is eastern Europe, particularly the Balkans. Although the European leagues are not formally aligned with the American NBA, there are links between European and American basketball. It is not uncommon for European players to be drafted by the NBA, nor is it uncommon for American players to play in Europe. American players in the European leagues tend to be older players who have finished successful NBA careers in the United States or younger players who have not yet been drafted into the NBA.

Play Of The Game
Court and equipment
The standard American basketball court is in the shape of a rectangle 50 feet (15.2 metres) by 94 feet (28.7 metres); high school courts may be slightly smaller. There are various markings on the court, including a centre circle, free throw lanes, and a three-point line, that help regulate play. A goal, or basket, 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter is suspended from a backboard at each end of the court. The metal rim of the basket is 10 feet (3 metres) above the floor. In the professional game the backboard is a rectangle, 6 feet (1.8 metres) wide and 3.5 feet (1.1 metres) high, made of a transparent material, usually glass; it may be 4 feet (1.2 metres) high in college. The international court varies somewhat in size and markings. The spherical inflated ball measures 29.5 to 30 inches (74.9 to 76 cm) in circumference and weighs 20 to 22 ounces (567 to 624 grams). Its covering is leather or composition.

Rules
The rules governing play of the game are based on Naismithís five principles requiring a large, light ball, handled with the hands; no running with the ball; no player being restricted from getting the ball when it is in play; no personal contact; and a horizontal, elevated goal. The rules are spelled out in specific detail by the governing bodies of the several branches of the sport and cover the playing court and equipment, officials, players, scoring and timing, fouls, violations, and other matters. The officials include a referee and two umpires in college play (two referees and a crew chief in NBA play), two timers, and two scorekeepers. One player on each team acts as captain and speaks for the team on all matters involving the officials, such as interpretation of rules. Professional, international, and high school games are divided into four periods, college games into two.

Since the 1895ñ96 season, a field goal has scored two points and a free throw one point. When the ABA was founded in 1967, it allowed three points for shots made from outside a boundary line set 25 feet (7.6 metres) from the basket. With varying distances, the change was adopted officially by the NBA in 1979 and, in 1985, by colleges.

Basketball is a rough sport, although it is officially a noncontact game. A player may pass or bounce (dribble) the ball to a position whereby he or a teammate may try for a basket. A foul is committed whenever a player makes such contact with an opponent as to put him at a disadvantage; for the 2001ñ02 season the NBA approved a rule change that eliminated touch fouls, meaning brief contact initiated by a defensive player is allowable if it does not impede the progress of the offensive player. If a player is fouled while shooting and the shot is good, the basket counts and he is awarded one free throw (an unhindered throw for a goal from behind the free throw, or foul, line, which is 15 feet [4.6 metres] from the backboard); if the shot misses, he gets a second free throw. If a foul is committed against a player who is not shooting, then his team is awarded either the possession of the ball or a free throw if the other team is in a penalty situation. A team is in a penalty situation when it has been called for a set number of fouls in one period (five in one quarter in professional and international play and seven in one half in the college game). In college basketball, penalty free throws are ìone-and-oneî in nature (consisting of one free throw that, if made, is followed by a second) until the opposing team commits a 10th foul in a half, creating a ìdouble bonusî situation where all fouls automatically result in two free throws. A pair of penalty free throws are immediately earned when teams enter the penalty situation in both the NBA and international play. Infractions such as unsportsmanlike conduct or grasping the rim are technical fouls, which award to the opposition a free throw and possession of the ball. Overly violent fouls are called flagrant fouls and also result in free throws and possession for the opposition. Players are allowed a set number of personal fouls per game (six in the NBA, five in most other competitions) and are removed from the game when the foul limit is reached.

Other common infractions occur when a player (with the ball) takes an excessive number of steps or slides; fails to advance the ball within five seconds while being ìclosely guardedî; causes the ball to go out-of-bounds; steps over the foul line while shooting a free throw; steps over the end line or sideline while tossing the ball in to a teammate, or fails to pass the ball in within five seconds; runs with, kicks, or strikes the ball with his fist; dribbles a second time after having once concluded his dribble (double dribble); remains more than three seconds in his free throw lane while he or his team has the ball; causes the ball to go into the backcourt; retains the ball in the backcourt more than 10 seconds, changed in the NBA to 8 seconds for 2001ñ02; or fails to shoot within the time allotted by the shot clock (24 seconds in the NBA, the WNBA, and international play; 30 in womenís college basketball; and 35 in menís college basketball). The penalty is loss of the ballóopponents throw the ball in from the side.


Common terms used in basketball include the following:

Blocking
Any illegal personal contact that impedes the progress of an opponent who does not have the ball.

Dribble
Ball movement by bouncing the ball. A dribble ends when a player touches the ball with both hands simultaneously or does not continue his dribble.

Held ball
Called when two opponents have one or two hands so firmly upon the ball that neither can gain possession without undue roughness. It also is called when a player in the frontcourt is so closely guarded that he cannot pass or try for a goal or is obviously withholding the ball from play.


Jump ball
A method of putting the ball into play. The referee tosses the ball up between two opponents who try to tap it to a teammate. The jump ball is used to begin games and, in the professional game, when the ball is possessed by two opposing players at the same time.

BRITANNICA QUIZ
Basketball Player Nicknames
Bill Bradley
Pass
Throwing, batting, or rolling the ball to another player. The main types are (1) the chest pass, in which the ball is released from a position in front of the chest, (2) the bounce pass, in which the ball is bounced on the floor to get it past a defensive opponent, (3) the roll pass on the floor, (4) the hook pass (side or overhead), and (5) the baseball pass, in which the ball is thrown a longer distance with one hand in a manner similar to a baseball throw.

Pivot
A movement in which a player with the ball steps once or more in any direction with the same foot while the other foot (pivot foot) is kept at its point of contact with the floor.


Pivot player
Another term for centre; also called a post player. He may begin the offensive set from a position just above the free throw line.

Rebounding
Both teams attempting to gain possession of the ball after any try for a basket that is unsuccessful, but the ball does not go out-of-bounds and remains in play.


Screen, or pick
Legal action of a player who, without causing more than incidental contact, delays or prevents an opponent from reaching his desired position.

Shots from the field
One of the main field shots is the layup, in which the shooter, while close to the basket, jumps and lays the ball against the backboard so it will rebound into the basket or just lays it over the rim. Away from the basket, players use a one-hand push shot from a stride, jump, or standing position and a hook shot, which is overhead. Some players can dunk or slam-dunk the ball, jamming the ball down into the basket.

Traveling (walking with the ball)
Progressing in any direction in excess of the prescribed limits, normally two steps, while holding the ball.

Turnover
Loss of possession of the ball by a team through error or a rule violation.

Other special terms are discussed below.

Principles of play
Each team of five players consists of two forwards, two guards, and a centre, usually the tallest man on the team. At the beginning of the first period of a game, the ball is put into play by a jump ball at centre court; i.e., the referee tosses the ball up between the opposing centres, higher than either can jump, and when it descends each tries to tap it to one of his teammates, who must remain outside the centre circle until the ball is tapped. Subsequent periods of professional and college games begin with a throw in from out-of-bounds. Jump balls are also signaled by the officials when opposing players share possession of the ball (held ball) or simultaneously cause it to go out-of-bounds. In U.S. college games the alternate-possession rule is invoked in jump ball situations, with teams taking turns getting possession. After each successful basket (field goal) the ball is put back in play by the team that is scored on, by one player passing the ball in from behind the end line where the score was made. The ball is put in play in the same manner after a successful free throw or, if two have been awarded, after the second if it is successful. After nonshooting violations the ball is awarded to the opposing team to be passed inbounds from a point designated by an official.

A player who takes possession of the ball must pass or shoot before taking two steps or must start dribbling before taking his second step. When the dribble stops, the player must stop his movement and pass or shoot the ball. The ball may be tapped or batted with the hands, passed, bounced, or rolled in any direction.

As basketball has progressed, various coaches and players have devised intricate plays and offensive maneuvers. Some systems emphasize speed, deft ball handling, and high scoring; others stress ball control, slower patterned movement, and lower scoring. A strategy based on speed is called the fast break. When fast-break players recover possession of the ball in their backcourt, as by getting the rebound from an opponentís missed shot, they race upcourt using a combination of speed and passing and try to make a field goal before the opponents have time to set up a defense.

Some teams, either following an overall game plan or as an alternative when they do not have the opportunity for a fast break, employ a more deliberate style of offense. The guards carefully bring the ball down the court toward the basket and maintain possession of the ball in the frontcourt by passing and dribbling and by screening opponents in an effort to set up a play that will free a player for an open shot. Set patterns of offense generally use one or two pivot, or post, players who play near the free throw area at the low post positions (within a few feet of the basket) or at high post positions (near the free throw line). The pivot players are usually the taller players on the team and are in position to receive passes, pass to teammates, shoot, screen for teammates, and tip in or rebound (recover) missed shots. All the players on the team are constantly on the move, executing the patterns designed to give one player a favourable shotóand at the same time place one or more teammates in a good position to tip in or rebound if that player misses.

Systems of defense also have developed over the years. One of the major strategies is known as man-to-man. In this system each player guards a specific opponent, except when ìswitchingî with a teammate when he is screened or in order to guard another player in a more threatening scoring position. Another major strategy is the zone, or five-man, defense. In this system each player has a specific area to guard irrespective of which opponent plays in that area. The zone is designed to keep the offense from driving in to the basket and to force the offense into taking long shots.

A great many variations and combinations have been devised to employ the several aspects of both man-to-man and zone defensive strategies. The press, which can be either man-to-man or zone, is used by a team to guard its opponent so thoroughly that the opposition is forced to hurry its movements and especially to commit errors that result in turnovers. A full-court press applies this pressure defense from the moment the opposition takes possession of the ball at one end of the court. Well-coached teams are able to modify both their offensive and defensive strategies according to the shifting circumstances of the game and in response to their opponentsí particular strengths and weaknesses and styles of play."
"Shaquille O'Neal keeps rap beef with Damian Lillard going with another diss track aimed at Blazers All-Star

It looks like the rap beef between Damian Lillard and Shaquille O'Neal isn't over just yet. The two sides have traded diss tracks about each other for the past week, and Shaq delivered the latest blow with far more explicit lyrics this time around. This all began when the Trail Blazers All-Star went on Joe Budden's podcast and said that he was a better rapper than Shaq. 

Of course, Shaq couldn't let it go. He's someone who always ensures that whether it's his basketball or rap career he's shown the respect he deserves. In his latest jab at Lillard titled ""Second Round Knockout (Dame D.O.L.L.A Diss),"" the Hall of Famer takes aim at Lillard's lack of championships, his weak bars in his songs, the way he dresses and said he would do to Lillard what Rajon Rondo did to Chris Paul -- a reference to the fight at Staples Center last season between the Rockets and Lakers, which resulted in Rondo and Paul trading punches. 

In Shaq's initial song, he said Lillard was a worse player than Trevor Ariza, and touted his MVP trophy while saying Lillard isn't even a candidate.

""MVP candidate you are not one, platinum plaques on my wall go and get you some,"" Shaq rapped. ""Take ya time to respond, there's no hurry. You'll never be Westbrook, never be Steph Curry.""

Lillard answered the challenge with not one, but two diss tracks back-to-back. Before heading to the first day of training camp for the Trail Blazers, the four-time All-Star dropped a three-minute track on Soundcloud titled ""Reign Reign Go Away."" Keep in mind, this isn't the first time Lillard has traded diss tracks with an NBA player. Earlier this year, Lillard and Marvin Bagley III traded barbs on social media too.


Lillard opened his first Shaq diss taking aim at new school vs. old school, calling Shaq's signature shoes terrible and declaring that Michael Jordan's ""Space Jam"" is better than Shaq's basketball movie, ""Blue Chips.""

""Shoulda just passed me the torch, I got no remorse I beat him like Rocky. You jealous of me and I see you, cause on this day originals just can't f--- with the sequel. New school got new hits. Space Jam not Blue Chips. Hey man your shoes s--- Dame 6 I'm too lit.""

Several times throughout the track, Lillard mentions how Shaq had help winning his titles. From his Lakers days with Kobe, ""We both could be working at Kinko's, and Kobe won you them rings tho."" To his final championship ring with Dwyane Wade in Miami, ""Kinda like the Cavs ain't really need Diesel's ass, and even in Miami won that on the strength of Flash.""

On the final bars of his diss track, Lillard signaled the end of Shaq's reign as the best rapper in the NBA, anointing himself as the ""chosen one.""


""Said that max was little, that $250 million crispy. Can't recall you getting that when I was cruising on a 10-speed,"" Lillard rapped. ""You had a moment though, you the pioneer, but I done reached the top of the point and the climate's clear. All of my bars are colder than any climate that's near, so if you looking for the stop to the reign you can find it here.""

In Lillard's second diss track about Shaq, titled ""I Rest My Case,"" Lillard raps, ""you not a rapper, you comedy, commentary an actor,"" before talking about Shaq's weight, age and lack of relevance. 

Lillard released both tracks before Shaq had a chance to respond, so after O'Neal's latest release, it's only a matter of time before Lillard gets back in the studio to come back with another rap or two. If this rap beef keeps going, maybe the two can do it live on the set of NBA on TNT just to see which one is the better battle rapper after all. "
"Ranking NBA's 20 best forwards: Takeaways from the league's most versatile position group

Centers dominated the NBA for most of its early history. There are more star point guards in the NBA than any other position. But make no mistake, the current league belongs to forwards. 

The last nine Finals MVPs have fallen under that banner, and it has more regular-season MVPs this century than either guards or centers do. Four of the top five players on our list of the top 100 players in the NBA were forwards, and the top seven players on this list all fall in the top 14. 

In honor of our Top 100 NBA rankings, let's take a look at the top 20 forwards in basketball, keeping in mind the following rules: 

Rankings are based on our list of the top 100 players in the league. 
Players are eligible to be ranked at multiple positions. Anthony Davis, for instance, is both a forward and a center. 
Both small forwards and power forwards are eligible. Anyone who falls under the forward umbrella would be considered. 
And so, here are the top 20 forwards in the NBA. 


TOP 20 FORWARDS IN THE NBA
1	
	LeBron James
Los Angeles Lakers SF
It stands to reason that the best player in the NBA would be the best at his position. The argument most have levied against James is, essentially, that a player his age shouldn't be this good, or healthy. Well guess what? He is, and King James' revenge tour is going to be one for the ages.
2	
	Kawhi Leonard
Los Angeles Clippers SF
James may be the best forward in the NBA, but Leonard is the most prototypical. He is not a bigger point guard. He does not slide up to center in smaller lineups. His job is to score points and prevent the best wing on the other team from doing the same. He does it with a cold efficiency befitting the second-best player in basketball.
3	
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
Milwaukee Bucks PF
Leonard is what forwards used to look like. Antetokounmpo is, hopefully, what they one day might look like. To say he does everything on the court is almost underselling his impact. Milwaukee's entire existence as a contender is made possible by his freakish athleticism and growing skill. If he adds a consistent 3-point shot, he'll top this list for the next decade.
4	
	Anthony Davis
Los Angeles Lakers PF
Davis is here strictly because he wants to be. He is optimally a center, but prefers playing power forward to preserve his body. Most players aren't effective enough at multiple positions to make that choice. Davis is so good that his teams consistently allocate resources to finding centers just to placate him. Even out of position, Davis is a top-five player in basketball.
5	
	Paul George
Los Angeles Clippers SF
George was arguably better than everyone on this list in the past regular season. He ultimately finished in third in MVP voting, but if he had stayed healthy, he could easily have won the award. Like Leonard, he is a prototypical scorer and defender. What you see is what you get, and what you get is one of the 10 best players in basketball.
6	
	Draymond Green
Golden State Warriors PF
Ask yourself a simple question: How good must a seven-point scorer be at practically everything else to garner a top-12 ranking in the entire NBA? The answer is nearly flawless. Fortunately, Green lives up to that billing and then some.
7	
	Jimmy Butler
Miami Heat SF
His defense may be slipping, he's never been an elite 3-point shooter and his locker-room antics would terrify most organizations. But despite all of that, there are few players more comfortable with the ball in their hands than Butler. His teams contend. Teams that lose him tend not to.
8	
	Blake Griffin
Detroit Pistons PF
Griffin only dunked 37 times last season. That was good for 94th in the NBA. The high-flyer of the Lob City days is gone, replaced by a more methodical, and in many ways more effective, point forward. The Pistons relied on Griffin to create most of their offense last season, and he delivered in getting them into the playoffs.
9	
	Pascal Siakam
Toronto Raptors PF
Siakam was the NBA's Most Improved Player last season, but you can make the argument that he is still a candidate to win the award again this season. With Leonard gone, the Raptors now belong to Siakam, and his scoring still has plenty of room to grow.
10	
	Al Horford
Philadelphia 76ers C
Everything said about Draymond Green applies to Horford as well, but with the added benefit that Horford actually does a bit of scoring. Few players have no holes in their game, but Horford is one of them.
11	
	Khris Middleton
Milwaukee Bucks SF
Middleton may play second-fiddle to the MVP, but he is an All-Star in his own right. He manages to perform the duties of both a role player and a star at once, playing stellar defense and spacing the floor while also contributing 18.3 points per game.
12	
	Kristaps Porzingis
Dallas Mavericks PF
Like Davis, Porzingis is a center cosplaying as a forward. And like Davis, it hardly makes a difference. Porzingis is so talented that he could thrive in just about any role.
13	
	LaMarcus Aldridge
San Antonio Spurs PF
The power forward position isn't dead yet. In a league desperate to produce Draymond Green clones, Aldridge continues chugging along. Even as a 33-year-old last season, he managed to make the All-Star game with his old-school scoring and rebounding.
14	
	Jayson Tatum
Boston Celtics SF
When LeBron James stared him in the eye, he didn't blink. Tatum was fine as a rookie and disappointing as a sophomore, but for two months in the spring of 2018, Tatum held his own against the best player of his generation and nearly took the Celtics to the NBA Finals. That gives him leeway no other young player gets, and a spot on this list despite fairly underwhelming numbers.
15	
	Kevin Love
Cleveland Cavaliers PF
Love may be stuck on a lottery team now, but if he proves he's healthy, he could turn into a big factor in the playoff race. His defense will always be questionable, but years supporting James as a role player have made fans forget just what a devastating offensive player he can be when properly featured.
16	
	Tobias Harris
Philadelphia 76ers SF
Harris has now played for five NBA teams, and he just seems to get better with each passing organization. Now a cornerstone of the co-Eastern Conference favorite Philadelphia 76ers, Harris could well be the closer on a team lacking traditional perimeter scoring.
17	
	Danilo Gallinari
Oklahoma City Thunder SF
Years of injuries have taken their toll, but Gallinari was finally healthy last season and became the go-to guy in the starting lineup for the Los Angeles Clippers. Like Love, he'll be a highly-coveted trade asset and could make a real difference in the playoff race.
18	
	Gordon Hayward
Boston Celtics SF
Hayward would have finished far higher than 18th on this kind of list prior to the ankle injury that ended his 2017-18 season before it really began. He likely finished above No. 18 on most lists of top overall players. The mere hope that the old Hayward is still in there gets him a spot on this list.
19	
	Paul Millsap
Denver Nuggets PF
You won't find many sturdier power forwards than Millsap. The veteran comes to work, puts up between 10 and 20 points, plays great defense and provides excellent leadership in his locker room. It's not fancy, but it's more than deserving of a spot on this list.
20	
	Jaren Jackson Jr.
Memphis Grizzlies PF
What do you get when you cross Davis' body with Horford's skill set? One of the best young players in all of basketball. Jackson is set to follow up an impressive rookie campaign with a breakout sophomore year.
So, what can we take away from this list? Here are the three biggest takeaways:

1. Forwards contain multitudes
Some players on this list, like James and Green, are point guards in the shape and size of a forward. Others, like Davis and Horford, are functionally centers and will play quite a few minutes there this season. Just about every playing style is represented on this list. Typically, the idea of positionless basketball comes down to having as many forwards on the floor as possible. They represent the compromise between center size and guard ball skills. As such, this list is far more stylistically diverse than one of guards or centers would be. 

2. Teamwork makes the dream work
The No. 1 forward (James) and the No. 4 forward (Davis) are on the same team. So are No. 2 (Leonard) and No. 5 (George), and No. 3 (Antetokounmpo) and No. 11 (Middleton). Leonard played with No. 9 (Siakam) last season, and No. 6 (Green) spent the last three seasons with Kevin Durant, who may have topped this list if he was healthy. Star forward tandems are a rarity in NBA history, but they are becoming more and more common. The success of the Lakers and Clippers this season could set a template that teams follow for years to come. 

3. Who's Next?
Only three players on this list are on rookie deals: Siakam, Tatum and Jackson. This is unsurprising considering the two-way responsibilities of the position. Forwards need to be two-way players, so developing takes longer than offensively-focused guards or rim-protecting centers. That makes it harder to predict who is coming up the pipeline. Siakam certainly wouldn't have made this list a year ago. Now, he's in the top 10. "
"Raptors, Kyle Lowry agree to one-year, $31 million extension after winning NBA title, per report

Teams that were potentially hoping to land veteran guard Kyle Lowry in free agency next summer will now have to wait another year. On Monday morning, the five-time All-Star, fresh off an NBA title, agreed to a one-year, $31 million contract extension with the Toronto Raptors, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. 

Lowry, 33, had one year remaining on the three-year, $100 million deal that he signed with the Raptors as a free agent in 2017, and he was set for unrestricted free agency in July. Now, he has two season and $64 million left on the books with Toronto, and he won't be a free agent until 2021. The two sides had been working to get a deal done for some time. Lowry's new deal has a bit of history attached to it, as with it he becomes the first player older than 33 to get an extension that includes a first-year salary-cap hit north of $30 million.

Lowry joined the Raptors in 2012, and he played a major role in turning the franchise into a perennial playoff team, as well as helping them win their first NBA title last spring. He has been named to five straight All-Star games, and was selected to the All-NBA Third Team in 2016. He is the longest-tenured Raptors player. 

""I think it's been a long time,"" Lowry said of his time in Toronto at media day last week, via the NBA. ""I've been here the longest now. I've been through the ups, downs. I was able to help bring a championship here from the times where they were talking about tanking for certain players. I'm not saying I'm the sole reason but I feel like I have a big part of it.""  


During his seven seasons in Toronto, Lowry has earned the respect of everyone from the fans, to the front office. Just last week, team president Masai Ujiri discussed the legacy that Lowry is leaving in Toronto. 

""Kyle has an incredible legacy here that I think we have all underrated,"" Ujiri said. ""There's legacy status for him in my opinion. Someone who has given it his all: five-time All-Star while we've been here -- could have been a six-time All-Star, that first one was a close shave. We were all disappointed. I remember exactly where I was when we heard.

""Everything he's given. We can say whatever we want about Kyle: He comes and he gives it his all on the court. He'll give me a headache once a month, but that's fine. That's our relationship. I really respect him for that. We'll always pay Kyle that respect.What he's done for this city, for this ball club, is remarkable. You all know: We're sitting here, there's many of you here, you all know when we sat down here six years ago, and we would never write this script, this way, in any form of dreams. And this is where it is. I'm proud of him for that.""

Last season, Lowry averaged a career-high 8.7 assists per game to go along with 14.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.4 steals. Now, he will be tasked with keeping the Raptors competitive following the departure of 2019 Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard over the offseason.  "
"Trae Young made his fair share of jaws drop during his rookie season.

It looks like Young is getting an early start this year. During the second quarter of Monday's preseason game between the Atlanta Hawks and New Orleans Pelicans, Young was racing down the court and completely nutmegged JJ Redick.

Redick swiped at the ball, but completely whiffed and looked foolish. Young ended up coasting for an easy layup on the play ahead of the Pelicans lackluster defense.

Young finished the game with 9 points on 4-of-10 scoring while recording a game-high 11 assists and grabbed four rebounds in 26 minutes. The Pelicans did end up winning the game, 133-109, behind 21 points from veteran guard Jrue Holiday.

The Hawks star guard finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting and put together averages of 19.1 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.7 rebounds. Young also wasn't afraid to shoot the ball from deep as he hit 32.4 percent from three with six attempts per contest.


Young has already produced highlight reel play after highlight reel play and absolutely embarrassed Redick on this one. Let's just say that this could be a common occurrence throughout Young's NBA career."
"Nikola Jokic's weight should not be a cause for concern, even if you think it is

NBA media days are designed to be optimistic. Fan bases need hope in a league that has been ruled by the LeBron-Warriors duopoly for the better part of a decade. So for one day, teams get to trot out their fully uniformed and not yet embittered rosters and pretend that anything is possible. 

The dark side of that coin is that when anything is possible, fans take that to mean that whatever they want is probable. No matter how delusional, expectations color the way media day messages are received, and the broad hope for Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was that he would arrive at training camp with a newly developed six-pack and the BMI of an Olympic gymnast. That's not exactly what happened.

There was never even the slightest reason to believe Jokic planned to shave significant weight this summer. He himself told Ohm Youngmishuk of ESPN in May that he prefers playing with more weight. But it's ""best shape of my life"" season, and while most players rave about the weight they've lost this time of year, Jokic has become a meme. Those that aren't joking about his preseason physique are lamenting it. If only this unique athlete could change one of the unique things about himself, social media cries, then he could reach his athletic peak. 

The obvious truth is that Jokic is doing just fine as is, and while we could all stand to log a few more minutes on the treadmill and swap some carbs out for vegetables, there isn't a particularly compelling reason for an MVP candidate at the top of his game to overhaul his training regimen and lose 30 pounds when he has achieved so much success in his present condition. If anything, doing so would probably hurt his game in its present state. Jokic prefers playing heavier for a reason. 

""To be honest, I like to be a little bit heavier like how I am right now,"" Jokic told Youngmisuk in May. ""I was lighter than this, say 15 pounds. But I didn't feel right. Because the guys are pushing me, I was not that heavy, I was light. I just needed a little bit more weight to keep up with those guys."" 

Jokic may operate on the perimeter and the high post plenty, but a big chunk of his scoring comes in or near the paint. Though he is more than capable of gunning from behind the arc, Jokic attempted the seventh-most post-ups per game in the NBA last season, per NBA.com. His 1.03 points per possessions on such plays are nearly identical to more celebrated low-post scorers like LaMarcus Aldridge (1.04) and Joel Embiid (1.05). In an NBA that gets smaller every year, Jokic finds most of his easy points by using his size to bully smaller defenders. 


The list of people who can bully Draymond Green is short. It's an ironic point given Green's role in the increased scrutiny placed on bigger centers defensively. Green, unlike Jokic, is a remarkable athlete, and his ability to defend most big men down low while also covering huge swaths of ground on the perimeter creates an unrealistic standard for players like Jokic. 


Jokic is not Green. He is never going to be able to defend guards on the perimeter. No amount of weight loss is ever going to change that. And for what it's worth, the Nuggets rose from 23rd in defense during the 2017-18 season to 10th last season thanks in large part to an updated pick-and-roll scheme that saw Jokic hedge ball-handlers at the point of attack before retreating to the bucket. 


This sort of scampering isn't exactly common. The Nuggets would be foolish to let Jokic, at any weight, run around with guards like this on a play-by-play basis. Again, he isn't Green, but his size didn't slow him down here, and it rarely did at all last season. Jokic fell in the 68th percentile in terms of pick-and-roll defense last season, per Synergy, and that doesn't even account for his most valuable trait on that end of the floor: Finishing possessions. 

Jokic is a tremendous rebounder, and his size is a big part of that. As he himself said, it prevents opponents from pushing him around. His 10.8 boards per game were 13th in the league last season, but he jumped all the way up to 13 in the playoffs. That led all players, which gets to the heart of the point here. 

There is anecdotal evidence that suggests that Jokic's size tangibly benefits him and enables elements of his playing style, but even if you don't believe it, you have to acknowledge that Jokic does, and that the placebo effect that belief creates is at least moderately beneficial. For losing weight to be the right approach for Jokic, the benefits would have to outweigh at least that placebo effect, if not the actual impact it has on his performance. The biggest argument in favor of that approach would be conditioning. A trimmer and therefore better conditioned Jokic would, in theory, would not wear down as quickly. 


But it's not as if Jokic is ineffective late in games. His field goal percentage in the fourth quarter last season was 49.3 percent compared to 51.1 percent overall, but such a decline is fairly common. The Nuggets, as a team, were three percentage points worse in fourth quarters than they were overall. His rebounding rate actually improved in fourth quarters, and his numbers were excellent in a limited overtime sample. 

Jokic certainly could stand to play a few more minutes. At 31.3 per game last season, he was dead last among All-NBA players. But the gap between he and similar centers is fairly minimal. Rudy Gobert was second-to-last on that list at 31.8, while Joel Embiid came in 11th out of 15 with 33.7. Both played fewer games than Jokic, though, and neither has yet been able to replicate their regular-season excellence in the postseason. 

And that is where the argument that Jokic needs to change anything falls to pieces, because he was sensational in the playoffs in every respect. He averaged 25.1 points, 13 rebounds and 8.4 assists per game, but more importantly, he played 39.4 minutes per contest. Only Paul George and Damian Lillard played more. Needless to say, neither of them are centers. 

The argument around conditioning and big men rarely asks them to play more on a nightly basis, but rather, demands evidence that they are capable of doing so when it counts. That Embiid wasn't able to last postseason, for instance, might have cost the Philadelphia 76ers a championship. When he was on the floor in the playoffs, the 76ers outscored opponents 20.8 points per 100 possessions. But he could only play 30.4 minutes per game in the playoffs, and when he sat, the Sixers were outscored by 21.6 points per 100 possessions. 


The Nuggets just don't have to worry about that when it comes to the player that literally played 64 minutes in a single playoff game last season. Even at his current size, Jokic has no substantial history of injuries. There aren't statistical markers that suggest he wears down late in games, and as the playoffs proved, he doesn't wear down late in seasons either. At this point in his career, he simply has no great need to lose weight. 

And if that ever changes, he'll have plenty of role models to look up. Jokic is 24 years old. Just look the difference between Marc Gasol at 24 and now.

Most star big men are not in the best shape of their lives at 24. The simple reason is that they don't need to be. Right now, Jokic sees a distinct advantage in being bigger than most of the players that he plays against. Eventually, as his body wears down with age, a time might come in which he decides that the increased mobility a skinnier frame would afford outweighs the benefits of that extra size. 

Many other star big men already have grappled with that realization. Most of them managed to transform their bodies at that point and extend their careers. But Kevin Love was an All-NBA player when he was bigger. So was Cousins. Gasol was a Defensive Player of the Year. None have reached such heights individually in their skinny states, though all have achieved newfound team success. 


The two don't have to be mutually exclusive. For Jokic's team to succeed, he needs to be at his absolute best. For him, and for many other big men, that means carrying more weight than what might be most aesthetically pleasing. If the result is another fourth-place MVP finish, the Nuggets will gladly accept whatever diet plan Jokic prefers. Don't try to fix something that isn't broken. "
"Top 100 NBA players for 2019-20: LeBron James edges Kawhi Leonard for No. 1; Zion Williamson only rookie to make the cut

How exactly is one supposed to approach ranking the best players in the NBA? There is no truly objective method, as even statistical models have their own biases built in. (PER famously overrates bigs who rebound well, which is how Jonas Valanciunas finished 11th in that metric last season, slightly ahead of Stephen Curry.) Further, while I consider Rudy Gobert and Bradley Beal top-20 players, neither could even dream of playing the other's role. Team context matters, which is why it makes perfect sense that Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni doesn't want to trade P.J. Tucker for anybody, but Tucker would not be seen as untouchable if he played for the rebuilding Cavaliers.

Just because you can't perfectly measure something, however, does not mean that you should not try. The Top 100 list presented here, an amalgamation of individual lists submitted by CBS Sports' writing staff, is not flawless, and you will strongly disagree with some of the rankings, as I do. The point is to examine the ideas behind the disagreements. 

If you are furious that Kyle Kuzma didn't make the cut, is it just because you're a Lakers fan or because you see something special in him? Maybe our staff collectively undervalues young players with star potential at the expense of role players who have proven that they contribute to winning. Maybe the panel is too high on versatile players who don't take anything off the table, unfairly punishing those who are more productive but have glaring weaknesses. Maybe there are cases where we have failed to properly appreciate a certain player's defense or basketball IQ or playoff performance. Making a Top 100 list forces you to think about all of this. Our hope is that reading it does, too. 


A disclaimer: This is not about who had the best season last year or who is on track to have the most impressive career. Our panelists were instructed to focus on the 2019-20 season alone. As such, Kevin Durant is not ranked. Neither are John Wall or Jusuf Nurkic. Klay Thompson is on the list, and if you think he's too low, it's because there is uncertainty about his return from a torn ACL. (If you think he's too high, it's because we are collectively optimistic that he will be back and be productive before the end of the regular season.) Now, to the rankings!

Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
1	
	LeBron James
Los Angeles Lakers SF
At 34 years old, LeBron is still the king. When James is at full strength, he operates on a level like no other player in the NBA -- and the wins tend to follow. The only question mark for LeBron heading into his 17th season is his health, but the injury that limited him to just 55 games last season could be a blessing in disguise, as he will be more rested than he has been in over a decade to start the 2019-20 campaign. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
2	
	Kawhi Leonard
Los Angeles Clippers SF
If you can get to a Clippers game early enough to watch Kawhi Leonard warm up, do it. He moseys around the court, nonchalantly making jumpers as if he's offended by the idea that a player such as himself needs to shoot around before games. It is astonishing. Even more extraordinary, though, is the fact that his demeanor is (almost) as casual after tipoff. When Leonard destroys you, he wants you to see how easy it is. The two-time Finals MVP is near the top of our list not just because he embodies everything you want from a No. 1 offensive option and might be the best perimeter defender of all-time, but because of his steely resolve. Everything he does is at his own pace, and, in the playoffs, if you need someone to stop a run or keep everybody composed, there is no one better. (And the Clippers may be getting a healthier version of Leonard than the Raptors did, which means he will be able to spend more possessions defending with the extreme intensity he was known for in San Antonio.) -- James Herbert
3	
	Stephen Curry
Golden State Warriors PG
Arguably the best offensive player on the league, Curry has a shot this season to remind us all just how great he can be when he's truly unleashed. Without Kevin Durant, and with Klay Thompson out for most of the regular season, the Warriors will have to depend heavily on Curry creating both consistent and improvisational offense for a suddenly vulnerable squad. Everyone thinks the Warriors will miss Durant's isolation prowess, and they will. But the numbers say Curry has actually been a better isolation player three of the past four years. He'll get to do more of that this season, and he'll get a steadier pick-and-roll diet, which the Warriors have shied away from in the past but will have to embrace this season. Curry is a monster pick-and-roll player, a savant off-ball mover, and with unlimited opportunity, he's going to have a monster season. Probably the preseason MVP favorite. -- Brad Botkin
4	
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
Milwaukee Bucks PF
Antetokounmpo made the leap to true superstardom last season, taking home his first MVP Award. Everyone knows what thre Greek Freak can do on the court, where his combination of size and athleticism makes him a nightmare for opponents on both ends of the floor. Now, the question becomes, how far can he take the Bucks? -- Jack Maloney
5	
	Anthony Davis
Los Angeles Lakers PF
Lost in the trade demand and awkward second-half pseudo holdout was a fact that should terrify the rest of the NBA. Last season, Davis hit new career highs in rebounds, assists and steals per game. He attempted more 3-pointers than he ever had before, and made a higher percentage than he ever had before. Ignore the games he played after his trade request and Davis would have set a new career-high in scoring as well. Davis isn't just the best big man in basketball. He's still getting better.-- Sam Quinn
6	
	James Harden
Houston Rockets SG
Harden's prolific isolation scoring is unlike anything we've seen in NBA history and therefore leads to endless debate about whether it's good for the team dynamic and if it's effective in the postseason. What's not debatable, however, is that nobody in the league can stop Harden from getting buckets. Add in his tremendous passing ability, and you have one of the top two guards in the NBA. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
7	
	Joel Embiid
Philadelphia 76ers C
Embiid was a legitimate MVP candidate last season, as he has developed into one of the league's most dominant players, on both ends of the floor. There isn't much that Embiid can't do out on the court, and there are few players that are more important to their team than Embiid is to the Sixers. Health has been the only issue that has hampered Embiid to this point in his career, but if he's able to stay healthy moving forward, he will continue to be in the conversation of the game's best players. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
8	
	Paul George
Los Angeles Clippers SF
George finished third in MVP voting, after averaging 28 points and eight rebounds a game, all while dealing with a nagging shoulder injury. George elected to put off shoulder surgery until after the playoffs to repair a small tear in his labrum, and that's not even the biggest thing to happen to him this offseason. George was surprisingly traded to the Clippers to join reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. There's no timetable on George's return, but before he was injured last season he had a case for winning MVP. Imagine what he can do when he's 100 percent healthy. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
9	
	Damian Lillard
Portland Trail Blazers PG
Lillard cracks the top 10 players in the league, and it's wholly deserved. So often overlooked in conversations about the league's biggest stars, all Lillard does is continue to get as much out of the Blazers, relative to their collective talent, as any star gets out of any team in the league. Portland, in the perpetually stacked Western Conference, has been a top-three seed in each of the past two seasons, and a top-five seed in five of the last six years. Forget Lillard's numbers. That's his value. And what do you know, people are doubting the Blazers again this season. Lillard will make them all look foolish yet again. -- Brad Botkin
10	
	Nikola Jokic
Denver Nuggets C
Debates have raged for years over how good Jokic actually is, but his performance last season put them to rest: he's a certified star and an MVP candidate. There is no one in the league quite like him, a 7-foot, 250-pounder who often operates as the Nuggets' point guard, and plays with a flair often reserved for those much smaller than him. -- Jack Maloney
c-jrue-holiday.jpg
Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
11	
	Karl-Anthony Towns
Minnesota Timberwolves C
At 23 years old, Karl-Anthony Towns has proven he is one of the most offensively-gifted big men in the league. What he lacks on defense he makes up for with his versatile post play and ability to step out and knock down 3s. Last season, Towns hit career highs in assists, free throw attempts and 3-point attempts per game. The Timberwolves may not make the playoffs, but the progression of Towns as one of the best young players in the league hasn't slowed down. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
12	
	Draymond Green
Golden State Warriors PF
Green averaged 7.4 points per game last season and is ranked just outside the top 10. That shows you the impact his All-NBA defense and playmaking have for the Warriors. He'll likely be asked to do a bit more offensively in 2019-20 with the absence of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, but his calling card comes in the form of his defensive instincts, communication and leadership. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
13	
	Bradley Beal
Washington Wizards SG
Beal just missed his first All-NBA nod last season, and he should be right in the mix again this season. A workhorse in the load-management era, Beal played all 82 last season at a career high 36.9 minutes per game. He has rounded into a complete star, equally deadly on and off the ball. He's a solid defender and a rising playmaker since he's been asked to do more of that in John Wall's absence. Of course, all the Beal talk right now is about  whether he'll be traded from a Wizards team seemingly going nowhere. Washington is still saying it intends to keep Beal, but we'll see how long that lasts. At 26 years old and just entering his prime, Beal is a premium commodity, and will likely, eventually, attract an offer or three that the Wizards will have to strongly consider. -- Brad Botkin
14	
	Jimmy Butler
Miami Heat SF
Pat Riley called Jimmy Butler a ""top 10 player"" in the league who could get ""27-7-7"" if you needed him to. He's probably not wrong. Butler is the definition of the ""two-way star"" we all trumpet these days. He's a lock-down, versatile defender. A tough, physical scorer. A better playmaker than people realize. When the game was on the line in the playoffs, the Sixers put the ball in Butler's hands and the Heat will certainly do the same. The Heat are a sneaky-good team, but they are not as good as Philly, which is a legit championship contender. So when Butler says he's all about winning, that nothing else matters, that's not entirely true. If it were, he would've wanted to return to Philly. At least some part of him yearns to be the unquestioned No. 1 guy, and he's definitely going to be that in Miami -- where, post-LeBron James, he represents the first major move in the direction of big-time winning for an organization desperate to get back on top . We'll see what he can do with the opportunity. -- Brad Botkin
15	
	Kyrie Irving
Brooklyn Nets PG
Fellow star players talk about Kyrie Irving with reverence. His handle, his range, his ridiculous finishes around the basket -- all of it is genuine artistry. The sublime skills and stats, though, have to be weighed against the other stuff, and a couple of our panelists rated Irving significantly lower than this. He wants the ball in his hands even though he is a threat without it. He talks about leadership publicly even though he hasn't proven himself to be adept in that area. His effort on defense waxes and wanes. At 27, on his third team, after an utterly bewildering second-round series, it is time for him to show the maturity that it takes to bring the Nets together. -- James Herbert
16	
	Kemba Walker
Boston Celtics PG
After eight seasons with the Hornets, Walker took the next step in his career by joining the Celtics in the summer. He's quick and shifty, a strong 3-point shooter and an elite pick-and-roll player, but the quiet leadership and stability he'll bring to this team may be most important after the tumultuous Kyrie Irving experience. -- Jack Maloney
17	
	Rudy Gobert
Utah Jazz C
How high would you rank someone who doesn't create offense on his own? How valuable can you be when you're exploitable in specific matchups? It's impossible to properly evaluate Rudy Gobert without wrestling with difficult questions like these. Is it a strike against him that, for the last three seasons, the Utah Jazz have been eliminated by teams who have targeted him in high pick-and-rolls? Potentially, but the Jazz's entire defensive scheme was built around Gobert dominating the paint, and that defensive scheme has ranked near the top of the league for essentially all of his tenure as a starting center. He is also an excellent roller, and Utah's improved spacing should make him even more dangerous in that regard this season. -- James Herbert
18	
	Blake Griffin
Detroit Pistons PF
Griffin has done an excellent job of developing his skill set to fit with the way that the game is played today. As a younger player, Griffin relied largely on his uncanny athleticism, but as his career wore on, he turned himself into an above-average shooter and playmaker. Now, he's a pretty complete package that can do damage in a multitude of ways. He averaged a career-high 24.5 points per game for the Pistons last season, and similar production should be expected this season. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
19	
	Russell Westbrook
Houston Rockets G
Throughout Russell Westbrook's 11 years in Oklahoma City, watching him meant feeling the tension between what he wants to do and what he should do if the goal is to optimize his efficiency. Now, on a team defined by its total devotion to optimization, something has to give. We could see the best version of Westbrook, a synthesis of his aggressive style and the Rockets' pragmatism, in which case this ranking will look silly. We could also see a mess that vindicates those who have questioned this experiment, in which case putting him in the top 20 will seem wildly optimistic. -- James Herbert
20	
	Jrue Holiday
New Orleans Pelicans PG
Only eight players in NBA history have made an All-Defensive team while averaging at least 21 points and seven assists. You could probably guess the first seven: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Jerry West, Gary Payton and John Havlicek. Holiday became the eighth last season. Such all-around dominance is a rarity in NBA history. -- Sam Quinn
NBA: Finals-Golden State Warriors at Toronto Raptors
Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
21	
	Ben Simmons
Philadelphia 76ers PG
The sky is the limit for Simmons, who was named an All-Star during his second season in the league. Simmons is lethal in the open court and possesses pinpoint, precision passing and uncanny court vision. He's an excellent rebounder and an above-average defender, with the potential to be an elite one. He's also an unbelievable athlete with an elevated basketball IQ. If he adds a jumper, it's over. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
22	
	Luka Doncic
Dallas Mavericks SF
A year ago, there were concerns over how well Doncic's game would translate to the NBA. After a historic Rookie of the Year season, it's fair to say he's doing just fine. To be ranked this high with only one season in the league speaks to the high expectations of Doncic's future in the NBA. Last season, he showed glimpses of becoming an elite playmaker, facilitator and scorer. Now, paired with another unique talent in Kristaps Porzingis -- and a full offseason of getting in shape under his belt -- it doesn't appear he'll succumb to the sophomore slump. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
23	
	CJ McCollum
Portland Trail Blazers SG
McCollum is one of the best 1-on-1 shot creators in the world. It's what he does. In the 2019 postseason, while Lillard was stealing headlines after burying the Thunder, it was McCollum who carried Portland through the most crucial stretches of the Denver series -- particularly in Game 7, when McCollum almost single-handedly lifted the Blazers to the conference finals with 37 of the toughest, 1-on-1 points you'll ever see. He also did almost all that work in the mid-range and at the bucket. McCollum is a mixtape ball handler with a poetically old-school 15-to-19 foot game. A walking bucket, you might call him. Very Lou Williams, but bigger and better. -- Brad Botkin
24	
	Mike Conley
Utah Jazz PG
He flies under the radar a bit due strictly to the sheer number of excellent point guards across the league's landscape, but Conley is a baller. He averaged 21.1 points and 6.4 assists per game for the Grizzlies last season, and he played an integral role in the organization's recent string of success during the 'Grit-n-Grind' era. Now in Utah, Conley will again have an opportunity to run a team with a shot at making some legitimate noise in a crowded Western Conference. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
25	
	Victor Oladipo
Indiana Pacers SG
Oladipo might be higher on the list were it not for a quad injury that will likely keep him out until December at the earliest. When healthy, however, Oladipo has proven himself to be an All-NBA talent on both ends of the court. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
26	
	Klay Thompson
Golden State Warriors SG
Thompson is only this low because our criteria was defined as who will have the most impact on this coming season, and he is out until at least after the All-Star break. Bottom line, he's a top-15 player in the world, on both ends. Steph Curry gets the glamour, but it was Thompson who carried the Warriors in some of the biggest games and moments of the last five years. He's the second-best shooter of all-time to Curry. He's improved dramatically at putting the ball on the floor, utilizing the leverage of his jump shot to get to the rim or to his mid-range sweet spot. He's a tough, versatile, high-motor defender who takes his 1-on-1 matchups with the best scorers in the world absolutely personally. Few players in the league, if any, garner more respect among their peers than Thompson. He's a flat-out gamer. And assuming he is back healthy for the playoffs, the Warriors are going to be a big-time problem once again.-- Brad Botkin
27	
	Donovan Mitchell
Utah Jazz SG
Mitchell upped his scoring and assist averages in his second year for the Jazz while handling primary playmaking duties. He should benefit the most from Utah's acquisitions of Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic, taking some of the offensive pressure and the opponents' defensive attention off of his shoulders. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
28	
	Pascal Siakam
Toronto Raptors PF
Nobody redefined himself in 2018-19 like Pascal Siakam, who ran away with the Most Improved Player award and opened the NBA Finals with a legendary performance. This time last year, it wasn't clear whether he or OG Anunoby was the Raptors' most valuable young forward, and Siakam had to earn his starting spot in training camp. Now the challenges he faces have a totally different flavor: How will he handle being the focal point of defensive game plans? Can he be The Guy for Toronto, or at least the guy who attracts other stars to join him? Siakam is an All-Defense type who scores well in isolation and still has upside based on his dedication to improvement and the fact that he only started playing organized basketball seven years ago. -- James Herbert
29	
	Al Horford
Philadelphia 76ers C
Horford brings to Philadelphia exactly what he brought to Boston: versatility, defense, veteran leadership and professionalism. He's getting up there in age (33), and his numbers might not be the gaudiest, but his ability to do so many different things out on the court is a big boon to Philadelphia's title hopes. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
30	
	Khris Middleton
Milwaukee Bucks SF
Middleton got PAID in the summer, signing the biggest deal ever (five years, $178M) for a former second-round pick. That will only add to the pressure he's already facing of trying to be the Bucks' second star alongside Giannis. He does just about everything well, but the Bucks may need him to be great if they want to win the East this season. -- Jack Maloney
De'Aaron Fox Sacramento Kings Purple
   Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
31	
	Chris Paul
Oklahoma City Thunder PG
Paul averaged 22.5 points, 12.5 assists and 5.4 rebounds per 36 minutes last season when James Harden wasn't on the floor. For his career, he has averaged 19 points, 9.9 assists and 4.6 rebounds per 36 minutes. Paul can still play. He just can't play under the thumb of the NBA's most ball-dominant superstar. If he can stay healthy, there is no reason to believe that Paul can't still muster an All-Star-caliber season. -- Sam Quinn
32	
	Devin Booker
Phoenix Suns SG
Over the course of his first four seasons in Phoenix, Booker developed into one of the most elite scorers in the entire NBA. However, his impressive production (he averaged 26.6 points per game last season, good for eighth overall in the entire league) has flown under the radar a bit due to the Suns' lack of success as a team; they have yet to even sniff the postseason during Booker's tenure with the team. Don't let that fool you, though; Booker is a deadly offensive threat, and at only 22 years old, you can expect even more overall improvement in his game moving forward. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
33	
	Kristaps Porzingis
Dallas Mavericks PF
Need proof that Porzingis is a unicorn? He was averaging 2.4 blocks and 1.9 3-pointers per game before getting hurt during the 2017-18 season. Nobody in NBA history had ever managed such numbers. He posted them as the 22-year-old leading scorer on one of the NBA's worst teams. Get used to markers like this. Porzingis produces a one-of-a-kind moment or number just about every time he steps on the floor. -- Sam Quinn
34	
	Kyle Lowry
Toronto Raptors PG
In terms of his career trajectory, Kyle Lowry seems to be following in the footsteps of Chauncey Billups, one of his mentors. After bouncing around, Lowry found a home in Toronto, where he became a perennial All-Star and, eventually, a champion. At 33 and eligible for an extension, his future with the Raptors is in question, but he has already demonstrated that he's willing to take a step back as a scorer and help his team win in other ways. You might argue that a sharp decline is coming, as small guards typically don't age well. The counter-argument is that players with genius-level basketball IQ typically do. -- James Herbert
35	
	Nikola Vucevic
Orlando Magic C
The Magic made the playoffs for the first time since 2012, largely because of the play of Vucevic. His 3-point shooting improved greatly, and his play was finally noticed around the league, earning him his first All-Star selection. Vucevic said he feels like he's just hitting his prime, and if that's the case, then the Magic will try and ride his talents into another postseason appearance. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
36	
	LaMarcus Aldridge
San Antonio Spurs PF
Steady as ever, Aldridge was once again one of the NBA's elite post-up scorers last season, and his mid-range jumper is close to automatic. He certainly isn't flashy, but Aldridge has been as reliable as they come since Kawhi Leonard left the San Antonio lineup. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
37	
	Jayson Tatum
Boston Celtics SF
Tatum was electric in his rookie season but took a step back along with just about everyone on the Celtics in their bizarre 2018-19 campaign. As a result, the Tatum hype train has slowed down a bit. Still, he's a super talented young player who can contribute on both ends of the floor, and it will be fascinating to watch how he develops this season. -- Jack Maloney
38	
	De'Aaron Fox
Sacramento Kings PG
After putting together an average rookie season, Fox took a huge leap in his sophomore season, showing improvement across the board from his shooting to his decision making. With another year of experience under his belt, Fox could help lead the Kings into the playoffs after falling short a year ago. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
39	
	Kevin Love
Cleveland Cavaliers PF
After missing 60 games for a lottery-bound Cavaliers team last season, Love kind of feels like a forgotten man in the NBA, but his ability to produce certainly shouldn't be forgotten. Love holds career averages of 18 points and 11 rebounds per game, and he played an integral role in Cleveland making four straight Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018. Though at 31 years old, he might be on the back end of his prime but could still be a key contributor to the Cavs, or a contender if he's ultimately traded. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
40	
	Jamal Murray
Denver Nuggets PG
If Murray was in the Eastern Conference, he would've been an All-Star. Regardless, the Nuggets rewarded him for his impressive season with a five-year $170 million max deal during free agency. There were times that Murray's play was the reason the Nuggets won games, and that's with an MVP-caliber player like Nikola Jokic on his team. Now that Murray's secured the bag, he'll need to continue to improve his effort on defense and consistency on offense to take the next step in his career. -- Jasmyn Wimbish

	Tobias Harris
Philadelphia 76ers SF
Harris has bounced around the league a bit over the course of his career, but after signing a monster deal with Philadelphia over the offseason, he appears to have finally found a long-term home in the league. Harris is a three-level scorer on the offensive end and a career 36 percent 3-point shooter, and the Sixers clearly feel like he can be a key cog in their quest for their first NBA title since 1983. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
42	
	Myles Turner
Indiana Pacers C
Turner's reputation is cursed by circumstance. He was perhaps the third-best regular-season defender in the NBA last season, but happens to share a position with Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid, so he couldn't earn an All-Defensive team nod. He'll have to settle for the blocked shots title he won last season and the knowledge that he still has plenty of room left to grow.-- Sam Quinn
43	
	DeMar DeRozan
San Antonio Spurs SG
DeMar DeRozan's first season with the Spurs was complicated. His assist rate rose dramatically, and his 48.1 percent mark from the field was his high-water mark (excluding his rookie season). He was less efficient overall, though, because he completely stopped taking 3s and had the lowest free throw rate of his career. In some ways, the DeRozan story is the same as it has been in recent years: he has made himself into an excellent scorer with a lot of moves, but his weaknesses from the arc and on defense hold him back in the playoffs. At 30, as the league assumes it has him figured out, can he write a new chapter? -- James Herbert
44	
	D'Angelo Russell
Golden State Warriors PG
Last season, Russell finally took the leap many have been expecting, bumping his scoring average past the 20 point-per-game mark with improved 3-point accuracy, which led to his first All-Star selection. He was squeezed out of Brooklyn when Kyrie Irving signed there, but was quickly swooped up by the Warriors, who hope that he'll be a key piece in their post-Kevin Durant retooling. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
45	
	Trae Young
Atlanta Hawks PG
Is Trae Young already a top 50 player in the world? We're projecting a bit here, for sure, but there's no denying Young's special talent. Even with a down shooting year next to what we expected of him coming out of Oklahoma, Young averaged 19.1 points and 8.1 assists as a rookie. Only two other rookies in NBA history have hit those marks -- Oscar Robertson and Damon Stoudamire. Young is a brilliant passer, and we don't use that word lightly. He might be the worst defender in the league at present, but as one scout told CBS Sports: ""I thought [Young's] defensive shortcomings would be far more debilitating than they were, to be honest. He's just that special offensively."" The Hawks are quietly one of the most exciting teams in the league with Young at the helm. Is it crazy to think he could push for an All-Star nod in the East as soon as this season? If the shooting comes around, which it should, a 20-10 season is feasible. That's very rare territory. -- Brad Botkin
46	
	Danilo Gallinari
Oklahoma City Thunder SF
Players tend not to set new career-highs in points, rebounds, assists and 3-pointers once they've hit their 30th birthday. That Gallinari did is a testament to his incredible perseverance. Injured on and off for years, Gallinari just had his healthiest season since tearing his ACL during the 2012-13 campaign. His offensive versatility and underrated defense will make him one of the best players on the trade market should the Oklahoma City Thunder choose to commit to a rebuild. -- Sam Quinn
47	
	Eric Bledsoe
Milwaukee Bucks PG
Bledsoe produced another stinker in the playoffs, which overshadowed just how good he was for the Bucks last season when he probably deserved an All-Star nod over Middleton. His work hounding opposing ball-handlers is vital to the Bucks' defensive scheme, and they'll need his driving ability on offense even more now that Brogdon is gone. -- Jack Maloney
48	
	Gordon Hayward
Boston Celtics SF
Before Hayward's brutal injury that sidelined him for all of 2017-18 and had him playing catch-up all of last season, he was tracking to be a top-20 fixture on lists like this one. Now he comes in at No. 48, and based on last season, even that feels generous. But if he's back to the real Hayward, it will prove way too low. Indeed, there's a buzz throughout the Celtics, from Danny Ainge on down, that Hayward has his explosion back. He had stretches last season, particularly in the playoffs, that suggested his game and confidence were coming around, with Boston running its offense through him as he got back to making plays off the bounce and knocking down 3-pointers. Will he start or come off the bench this season? With Walker, Jayson Tatum and a big man likely set in stone, that leaves Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Hayward for two starting spots. My guess is Hayward starts. The Celtics need to do everything they can to get him going again. -- Brad Botkin
49	
	Brook Lopez
Milwaukee Bucks C
In terms of role players, there might not be anyone in the league more important to their team than Lopez is to the Bucks. The degree to which he was launching 3s last season bordered on absurd, but he was knocking them down and that spacing he provides at the 5 makes their whole system work. -- Jack Maloney
50	
	Lou Williams
Los Angeles Clippers SG
They might as well name the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award the ""Lou Williams Trophy."" Taking the honor home for the third time in his career last season, Williams displayed improved playmaking ability to complement his elite bucket-getting, notching a career-high 5.4 assists per game. He'll be tasked with the same role this season for a Clippers team with championship aspirations. -- Colin Ward-Henninger

51	
	Paul Millsap
Denver Nuggets PF
Millsap should be flattered by the biggest move the Nuggets made this offseason. They were so happy with his play last season that they went out and acquired a younger duplicate of his in Jerami Grant. Of course, while Grant matches Millsap's defensive versatility and stroke from behind the arc, there's a reason he didn't land as high on this list. He may not be able to bring it every night as he hits his mid-30's, but Millsap's scoring was Denver's offensive security blanket in the postseason. He is dependable on a game-by-game basis, but can still kick things up a notch when necessary. -- Sam Quinn
52	
	Jaren Jackson Jr.
Memphis Grizzlies PF
Jackson performed ahead of schedule for the Grizzlies last season as the league's second-youngest player (he just turned 20 in September). At 6-11, he's already an elite defender and rim protector, and he shot an impressive 36 percent from 3-point range on the offensive end. Jackson's minutes were limited by foul trouble and injuries last year, so with a full, healthy season, he could move up on this list rapidly. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
53	
	Marcus Smart
Boston Celtics PG
Smart is the one true king of Weird Celtics Twitter, which is quite the honor. He plays with an intensity and passion that few are able or interested in matching and is an absolute menace on the defensive end. It will be interesting to watch if his improved 3-point shooting from last season -- 36.4 percent -- is real. -- Jack Maloney
54	
	Aaron Gordon
Orlando Magic PF
It's hard to believe that Gordon is entering his sixth year in the league, but last season was arguably his best to date. He's not forcing as many shots as he did during the 2017-18 season, his 3-point percentage jumped up to 34.9 percent and he's blossomed into becoming one of the best wing defenders in the league. He's yet to have a breakout season, which could either be a good or bad thing for the Magic. If Gordon hits new heights in his development this season, the Magic could make the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 2012. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
55	
	Jaylen Brown
Boston Celtics SG
Brown had a really rough start to last season and was never able to shake that perception even though he played quite well after the first month or so. He's a strong defender, a solid spot-up shooter and an elite athlete. There's no question he's already a nice role player, but this is a big season for him to prove he's more than that. -- Jack Maloney
56	
	Clint Capela
Houston Rockets C
Two summers ago, Capela signed a five-year $90 million deal. This offseason, he was at the center at several trade rumors. It wasn't because of his play as he posted career averages for the third year in a row, but a traditional center like Capela in an offense that lives and dies by the 3-ball isn't always the best fit. He's one of the best rim-running bigs in the league, but his free-throw shooting makes him a target late in close games. He doesn't have a lot of versatility on offense, but he makes up for it with his intensity and defense. If some of the shooting ability on this Rockets roster can rub off on Capela just a tiny bit, the next step for him could be an All-Star appearance. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
57	
	Steven Adams
Oklahoma City Thunder C
Perhaps no player is in for as big of a statistical increase this season than Adams is in the rebounding department now that he doesn't have to fight his point guard for them. But in all seriousness, Adams is just the definition of a solid player. He's big and strong, does all the dirty work and will show up every night ready to play. -- Jack Maloney
58	
	John Collins
Atlanta Hawks PF
John Collins is at once a curiosity and a proven commodity. Anyone who watched the Hawks in the second half of last season knows that he is a perfect pick-and-roll partner for Trae Young, a fantastic rebounder and an increasingly accurate shooter. It is completely unclear, though, where his game will go from here. Collins has the tools to be a disruptive defender, but sometimes bigs need years to learn how to read the game on defense, if they ever do at all. He also wants to do everything on offense, and the Hawks should let him stretch his wings. -- James Herbert
59	
	Gary Harris
Denver Nuggets SG
Three-and-D players are a precious commodity, but even rarer are those capable of performing both roles while also providing meaningful ball-handling. Harris may have shot 38.7 percent from behind the arc over the past three seasons and he may be a strong defender, but he is not Danny Green. Prior to Jamal Murray's emergence, Harris served as the Nuggets' primary perimeter scorer, and now that the two are both healthy and comfortable sharing the ball, Denver's offense should be more dangerous than ever. -- Sam Quinn
60	
	Andre Drummond
Detroit Pistons C
Drummond can be a tricky player to place on these sorts of lists because he puts up monster numbers but isn't always the most impactful in terms of winning. He was excellent down the stretch last season, though, and at the very least is a big, athletic presence inside and an elite rebounder. He's valuable, even if he isn't a star. -- Jack Maloney

Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
61	
	Caris LeVert
Brooklyn Nets SG
On this list, you will not find a player ranked lower who was clearly their team's best player in the 2019 playoffs. And, based on how Caris LeVert played during the Nets' first-round series and before his early-season leg injury, we have underrated him. Now he just needs to make that level of play normal, and perhaps make some strides with his shooting. Can he continue his rise as the No. 2 guy next to Irving? The answer to that question is important, particularly because he'll be the No. 3 guy when Durant comes back. -- James Herbert
62	
	Malcolm Brogdon
Indiana Pacers PG
From a second-round pick to $85 million dollar man in just three seasons. The Bucks' decision not to match that deal will be discussed for years to come, but the Pacers certainly aren't complaining. Brogdon isn't ever going to be a star, but he's smart, a versatile defender and joined the 50/40/90 club last season; he can play. -- Jack Maloney
63	
	Josh Richardson
Philadelphia 76ers SG
Richardson is an excellent -- perhaps slightly underrated -- two-way player that is able to play lockdown perimeter defense on one end, while also providing reliable floor-spacing on the other. He should benefit big time from playing off of dominant paint players like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in Philadelphia. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
64	
	Buddy Hield
Sacramento Kings SG
Hield has steadily improved since entering the NBA in 2016, and there's no reason to think that the improvement won't continue. Hield is a gifted floor-spacer who has shot nearly 42 percent from long range over the course of his career. As a key piece of a young Kings team that is expected to make some noise in the West, Hield could be poised for his best season yet. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
65	
	Marc Gasol
Toronto Raptors C
No longer an A-list player, Marc Gasol would still rank near the top of this list if it were about guys you'd want to play with. If Kyle Lowry was the Raptors' version of Chauncey Billups, then Gasol was Rasheed Wallace, the trade-deadline acquisition that took them to the next level. Giannis Antetokounmpo said Gasol and Kawhi Leonard ""made me a better player"" after they swarmed him in the conference finals, and I'm not sure if Nikola Vucevic has recovered from what Gasol did to him in the first round. -- James Herbert
66	
	Joe Ingles
Utah Jazz SF
Ingles no-showed in the playoffs last season, which obscured the fact that he put together yet another solid campaign for the Jazz. One of the best spot-up shooters in the league, and a crafty playmaker, he should benefit a lot from the Jazz's offseason additions of Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic. -- Jack Maloney
67	
	Zion Williamson
New Orleans Pelicans SF
Zion Williamson is the only rookie on this list, and he is one of the more divisive players among our panelists. If you can't figure out exactly what he'll look like at the next level, maybe it is because there has never been anyone quite like him. I can't recall another prospect who has been compared to both Draymond Green and Vince Carter, and Williamson is much larger than both of them. It speaks to his versatility that, on a completely unfamiliar Pelicans team, he seems like the kind of player who will help make the pieces fit. -- James Herbert
68	
	Robert Covington
Minnesota Timberwolves SF
After being the main piece of the return package from Philadelphia for Jimmy Butler last season, Covington played in only 22 games with the Timberwolves, so he didn't really get an opportunity to show what he is able to do. What he can do, however, is spread the floor (he's a career 36 percent 3-point shooter) and play lockdown perimeter defense (he was First-Team All-Defense two seasons ago) as one of the league's better two-way perimeter players. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
69	
	Eric Gordon
Houston Rockets SG
Gordon is a bucket-getter, and he's one of the main reasons why the Rockets have been so deadly on the offensive end over the past few seasons. Gordon has averaged 16 points per game for his career, and is a 37 percent shooter from long range, which makes him a perfect weapon for Mike D'Antoni's pace-and-space-based offense. Considering the fact that opposing defenses will be forced to focus a lot of their energy on the dynamic duo of James Harden and Russell Westbrook, Gordon could be in line for a huge season in Houston. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
70	
	P.J. Tucker
Houston Rockets SF
On a team that is average at best on the defensive end of the floor, Tucker is arguably the anchor that holds everyone accountable. He posted the second-highest Plus-Minus on defense for the Rockets last season, and was second in defensive win shares behind James Harden. Kevin Durant has called Tucker the best 1-on-1 defender in the league, and it's for good reason. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
NBA: New Orleans Pelicans-Media Day
Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
71	
	Domantas Sabonis
Indiana Pacers PF
Most teams are turning power forwards into centers as the NBA gets smaller and smaller. The Pacers are going in the other direction. They are so confident in Sabonis that they plan to play him at power forward this season despite allocating 79 percent of his minutes to the center position since acquiring him two summers ago. Most big men would struggle with so much size on the floor, but Sabonis' elite passing and rebounding have become so valuable that restraining it on the bench is no longer wise regardless of who else is on his team. -- Sam Quinn
72	
	Bojan Bogdanovic
Utah Jazz SF
Potentially one of the more pivotal free-agent signings, Bogdanovic is one of the best shooters in the world -- 42.5 percent from 3-point range last season -- and a perfect fit in Utah. His new teammates are already raving about the shooting displays he's putting on in practice, but Bogdanovic is more than just a shooter; he's a scorer who averaged over 18 points per game last season. He can put the ball on the floor. He scores in the mid-range. As mentioned above, Bogdanovic has the size at 6-8 to be a perfectly adaptable, tough-ish defender in Utah's elite defensive scheme. With Bogdanovic, Mike Conley and Joe Ingles, the Jazz are finally going to have optimal spacing to turn Donovan Mitchell completely loose as a rim attacker, making the addition of Bogdanovic not just a great one for Utah from a pure production standpoint, but in terms of being a perfect fit, as well. -- Brad Botkin
73	
	Derrick White
San Antonio Spurs PG
White has played less than 100 games in his NBA career, but he flashed a whole lot of potential during the 84 games that he has played over the past two seasons. In 2018-19, White really began to make a name for himself in San Antonio -- and across the league -- with per game averages of 9.9 points, 3.9 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.0 steal. Look for him to build on those numbers this season. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
74	
	Marvin Bagley III
Sacramento Kings PF
The NBA is filled with small forwards who can play center, but how many centers exist that can shift down to small forward? The Kings certainly seem to believe Marvin Bagley is one of them, and while the depths of his versatility are not yet fully known, the mere fact that the question needs to be asked is telling. Bagley's combination of size and skill as a ball-handler is extremely rare even among top picks. The Kings have surrounded him with virtually every kind of front-court partner under the sun, so this season will help reveal just how unique Bagley truly is. -- Sam Quinn
75	
	Lauri Markkanen
Chicago Bulls PF
Over two seasons, Markkanen has averaged 16 points and eight rebounds and has shown his range from nearly every spot on the floor. The only downside: He hasn't been able to stay healthy long enough to allow the Bulls to launch themselves back to playoff contention. He's missed 44 games in his two years in the league, but when healthy, he's undoubtedly the most talented Bulls player with the most upside. However, if he's injured frequently his impact won't be useful for Chicago. The Bulls finally have a talented young core, and Markkanen could reap the benefits the most if this team can develop together. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
76	
	Brandon Ingram
New Orleans Pelicans SF
Ingram will get the chance to start his career anew with the Pelicans on a roster full of youth and athleticism. He may wear a label of ""underachiever"" for now, but his numbers have been very good the past two seasons and he's still just 22 years old. If he can stay healthy, he's poised for a breakout season. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
77	
	Zach LaVine
Chicago Bulls PG
In his first fully healthy season in Chicago, LaVine was the major reason the Bulls won most of their games -- albeit just 22 of them. He's a pure offensive talent who had 3 40-point games last season. He's outgrown the high-flying guard image that brought him so much attention from competing in the dunk contest, and is showing why he is someone the Bulls should attach themselves to long term. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
78	
	Montrezl Harrell
Los Angeles Clippers PF
The consummate undersized overachiever, Harrell has become one of the best roll men in the league and a vital part of the Clippers' resurgence. He and Lou Williams form an absolutely devastating pick-and-roll combo off the bench, and they should be able to work their magic once again this season. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
79	
	Lonzo Ball
New Orleans Pelicans PG
All the ingredients are there for Ball to have a breakout 2019-20 campaign in New Orleans. He's going to be at the head of a pedal-to-the-metal attack with athletes and shooters around him. He won't have to play off the ball as much, where he was neutralized with the Lakers, and alongside LeBron James, as an out-of-place spotty shooter. On that note, Ball appears to have changed his shooting form this summer, bringing his release from the extreme left position to more in front of his face. It should quicken his release and allow him to shoot easier going right, which used to be a problem having to bring the ball back so far left, and thus, straight into the defender. Ball is already a big-time defender, a great passer, and his court feel and instincts have been the foundation of his game from the start. In New Orleans, with the ball in his hands, those traits will finally be able to fully shine. If he becomes a good shooter on top of that,  we're talking about a legitimate star in the making. -- Brad Botkin
80	
	Patrick Beverley
Los Angeles Clippers PG
The main attraction is the defense. It seems frankly unnatural that Patrick Beverley can summon the energy that he does to pester opponents on a night-to-night basis, and this is the kind of attribute that helps teams overachieve. Do not, however, overlook the shooting. Beverley has hovered around the 40-percent mark from 3-point range for four straight seasons, which separates him from other stoppers. -- James Herbert
usatsi-10816572-fred-van-vleet-raptors-g1.jpg
Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
81	
	Otto Porter Jr.
Chicago Bulls SF
After being traded from the Wizards to the Bulls, Porter looked like a new man in his 15 games, averaging 17 points on 48.3 percent from the field and 48.8 from beyond the arc. It's unlikely he'll maintain that type of efficiency over the course of a whole season, but any production from him will help Chicago. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
82	
	Justise Winslow
Miami Heat SF
Winslow has a chance to make this ranking look way too low by season's end. He says he wants to play point guard, but everyone from Pat RIley to Erik Spoelstra and Jimmy Butler have made it clear that the Heat, like pretty much every team in the modern NBA, will play a positionless brand of basketball. Winslow's value lies in his versatility and strength on both ends. He's proven he can make plays off the bounce when called up, as he was last season when Goran Dragic was out for an extended time, and we know Winslow can defend at an elite level. -- Brad Botkin
83	
	Derrick Favors
New Orleans Pelicans PF
Consistency is what you're going to get when it comes to Derrick Favors. He holds career averages of 11 points and seven rebounds per game, and you can expect that type of production every time he suits up, in addition to some solid interior defense. He's not flashy, but he gets the job done. In his new home of New Orleans, Favors will get to continue his consistent career while providing some veteran leadership for a young, and promising, Pelicans team. -- Michael Kaskey-Blomain
84	
	JJ Redick
New Orleans Pelicans SG
Long known as one of the best 3-point shooters and floor-spacers in the NBA, Redick averaged a career-high 18.1 points per game last season with the 76ers as a 34-year-old. His off-ball movement and dribble hand-offs ignited easy offense during his time with the Clippers and Sixers, and he should have a similar role with the Pelicans this season. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
85	
	Julius Randle
New York Knicks C
The Pelicans were extremely prepared to land Zion Williamson in the NBA Draft because they employed his closest offensive facsimile last season. To call Randle a point-forward would be inaccurate. He's more like a point-tank, a bowling ball who is nearly unstoppable barreling toward the basket that somehow still has the skill to post over three assists per game. Randle, now with the Knicks, has yet to find a team willing and able to invest in his development, but when he does, watch out. You won't find many big men scarier with the ball in their hands than Randle. -- Sam Quinn
86	
	Deandre Ayton
Phoenix Suns C
Overshadowed by tremendous first-year performances from Luka Doncic and Trae Young, Ayton became the only rookie in NBA history to average at least 16 points and 10 rebounds while shooting over 58 percent from the floor. The 2018 No. 1 overall pick should continue to improve on both ends for a Suns team looking to take a step in a positive direction. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
87	
	Thaddeus Young
Chicago Bulls SF
One of the reasons the Bulls will be far better than they were last season is because of the signing of Young. He'll provide much-needed veteran leadership to an incredibly young core, and his defensive intensity will hopefully inspire others to bring it on that end of the floor as well. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
88	
	Fred VanVleet
Toronto Raptors PG
A vital part of the Raptors' run, Fred VanVleet plays with the moxie you'd expect from an undrafted 6-foot point guard. He can play on or off the ball and is unafraid to take deep 3s. His defense is unbelievable for someone his size. Regardless of whether or not he starts next to Lowry or serves as Toronto's sixth man, this season will be about proving that he is qualified to run a team going forward. -- James Herbert
89	
	Harrison Barnes
Sacramento Kings SF
To be honest, this ranking is a bit too low for Barnes. There are times when he drives into three defenders without kicking to the open guy on the 3-point line, and he sometimes disappears in games. However, he's the type of guy anyone would want in their locker room. He might not be as valuable as he was during the early days of the Warriors dynasty, but he'll still give you 15 points a night and lockdown defense. -- Jasmyn Wimbish
90	
	Danny Green
Los Angeles Lakers SF
The Los Angeles Lakers so needed a player like this. Danny Green is a classic 3-and-D guy, and he is on the list because of the way he will stabilize lineups next to LeBron and A.D., especially during the regular season. He is not higher on the list because, in the playoffs, he did not have the same kind of impact. -- James Herbert
Jarrett Allen
Mike Meredith/CBS Sports
91	
	Spencer Dinwiddie
Brooklyn Nets PG
Dinwiddie's evolution into one of the NBA's best bench scorers has been one of the unlikeliest stories of the past few years. A man who never took 10 shots per game in three years in college launched 12.2 per game last season. He made only 45.9 percent of his shot attempts within three feet of the rim as a rookie. He had a higher field goal percentage on such shots last season than James Harden. His growth has been nothing short of astounding, and while his opportunities may be limited on a star-studded Nets team moving forward, betting against Dinwiddie at this point just seems foolish. -- Sam Quinn
92	
	Goran Dragic
Miami Heat PG
With the acquisition of Jimmy Butler and all of Justise Winslow's talk about wanting to play point guard, Dragic -- you know, the Heat's incumbent starting point guard -- feels like something of a forgotten man in Miami. Dragic isn't quite the player he used to be, but he's still solid, and Erik Spoelstra made it clear at Miami's media day that Dragic will have the ball in his hands plenty. He's still a crafty playmaker in the pick-and-roll and off dribble handoffs, he can shoot the 3 and he's gritty defensively. Not counting last season, when he only played 36 games due to injury, Dragic scored over 20 and 17 points per game in his last two full campaigns. -- Brad Botkin
93	
	Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Oklahoma City Thunder PG
How many point guards are ever described as a jack of all trades? Gilgeous-Alexander may not have an elite skill, but he does just about everything on the basketball court at a high level. His 6-6 frame makes him a ferocious defender and rebounder for his position, and his shot is already better than most expected it would ever be. Once his playmaking catches up to the rest of his game, Gilgeous-Alexander has a chance to be one of the best point guards in basketball. -- Sam Quinn
94	
	Jonas Valanciunas
Memphis Grizzlies C
Valanciunas fell into a timeshare situation with Serge Ibaka in Toronto, but he proved he's still a legitimate starting center by averaging 20 points, nearly 11 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 19 games with Memphis to end last season. He was rewarded with a three-year contract from the Grizzlies, who will look to him as a veteran leader on a rebuilding team. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
95	
	Jerami Grant
Denver Nuggets SF
After a breakout season with the Thunder, Grant was traded to the Nuggets where he will join a team with championship hopes. He shot nearly 40 percent from the 3-point line last season while providing defensive length and versatility. Grant should be an excellent piece for a stacked Denver squad. -- Colin Ward-Henninger
96	
	Jonathan Isaac
Orlando Magic PF
Isaac possesses one of the higher variances in the league this season; he could either be a pretty decent, but kind of out-of-place player in Orlando with unrealized defensive potential and no definitive offensive value, or he could break out as a capable 3-point shooter who finds his niche offensively and absolutely dominates defensively. He should do the latter. He was built in the modern-NBA-defender lab -- long, athletic, instinctive and smart, and word is he's put on substantial bulk this summer. Isaac can be the best player on the Magic. He has that kind of ability. -- Brad Botkin
97	
	Serge Ibaka
Toronto Raptors PF
Ibaka had a bit of a bounce-back season and was instrumental in the Raptors capturing their first title in franchise history. His shot completely abandoned him last season, which is a bit concerning if that trend continues, but he's still a versatile, athletic big, and that's valuable in today's NBA. -- Jack Maloney
98	
	Bam Adebayo
Miami Heat C
Adebayo gets his shot as the clear-cut No. 1 center now that Hassan Whiteside is in Portland, and if he continues to build on what he's shown in flashes through his first two seasons, he could be one of this year's breakout players. Adebayo can be a defensive monster, both at the rim and as a 6-10 super athlete who can switch onto the perimeter and legitimately defend some of the best 1-on-1 scorers in the game. Offensively, his game is coming around. He's an athletic roller and a developing post player. He can face up. And he wants to be great. People with the Heat rave about his work ethic. You combine that kind of gym-rat mentality with the kind of natural gifts Adebayo has, and you've got a good chance of a really good player emerging. -- Brad Botkin
99	
	Joe Harris
Brooklyn Nets SG
Harris shot 47.4 percent from behind the arc last season. That is what he brings to the table. His entire skill set can be boiled down to that one number, but it is such an impressive one that he is a worthy inclusion on this list. Harris might not have been the driver of Brooklyn's surprisingly effective offense, but he was arguably its engine. The Nets scored 109.6 points per 100 possessions with Harris on the floor last season, a team-high among those who played at least 30 minutes all of last season. When he sat? That number declined to 105.3. As long as Harris can shoot like that, he will belong on this list. -- Sam Quinn

Brooklyn Nets C
The center was supposed to be a project, but Jarrett Allen earned a starting spot three months into his career and has since established himself as one of the Nets' cornerstones, protecting the paint from a long list of opposing stars along the way. Or at least that was the story before they signed DeAndre Jordan, who will compete with the 21-year-old for a starting spot in training camp. Brooklyn is suddenly serious, but it should remain invested in Allen's upside. -- James Herbert"
"NBA Top 100 player rankings, a team-by-team breakdown: Pelicans boast the most, Lakers' depth could be a concern

After a significant amount of player movement during the summer, the landscape of the NBA looks completely different heading into the 2019-20 season. Some teams improved considerably through free agency and trades, securing a handful of players on our Top 100 list, while other teams -- like the Charlotte Hornets -- lost their lone All-Star, leaving them with no representation from the top 100 best players in the league.

One interesting takeaway from this team-by-team breakdown is seeing the after effects of the Anthony Davis trade. The Lakers obviously got the guy they wanted, but at the cost of losing all their youth and depth. Therefore, they only have three players -- Davis, LeBron James and Danny Green -- on their team from our Top 100 list, although two happen to sit in the top five! The Pelicans, on the other hand, are the only team in the league to have six players represented in our Top 100, thanks largely to that blockbuster Davis trade, as well as drafting Zion Williamson and adding JJ Redick in the offseason.

On paper, it shouldn't concern the Lakers too much, considering they are title contenders, and the Pelicans likely won't make the playoffs in the West. However, the lack of depth could hurt the Lakers in the postseason, when role players become a huge factor in team success. That's why teams like the Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Clippers are favored more heavily to win the championship, because both of those teams have five players on the Top 100 list.  


These breakdowns aren't the end-all determiner of team success this season, because we know having LeBron James on your team covers up a significant amount of weaknesses. But for teams like the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat, knowing they have four guys from the Top 100 list on their team is a positive sign when their goal is to get back to the playoffs. 

Team with six players in the Top 100

Pelicans
Top 100 Players: Jrue Holiday (20), Zion Williamson (67), Brandon Ingram (76), Lonzo Ball (79), Derrick Favors (83), JJ Redick (84)

The Pelicans will feature essentially an entire new lineup after trading away Anthony Davis, who landed them a lot of young talent in return. Zion Williamson may command most of the spotlight this season, but Jrue Holiday is the leader of this team, and could will New Orleans into fighting for a playoff spot in the West. Last season, the Pelicans ranked second in the league in pace (103.89), and with a new crop of talent they could look to rank near the top again with a more well-rounded team.

Teams with five players in the Top 100

Celtics
Top 100 Players: Kemba Walker (16), Jayson Tatum (37), Gordon Hayward (48), Marcus Smart (53), Jaylen Brown (55)

Out with Kyrie Irving, in with Kemba Walker and the Celtics are still one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Continued improvement from Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will be a good predictor of how far this Celtics team will go in the postseason. Gordon Hayward made steps toward becoming the player he was before his gruesome ankle injury in 2017. If he's able to return to averaging 21 points a night that made him an All-Star in Utah, Boston could challenge for a top three seed in the East.


Nets
Top 100 Players: Kyrie Irving (15), Caris LeVert (61), Spencer Dinwiddie (91), Joe Harris (99), Jarrett Allen (100)

If Kevin Durant was healthy, the Nets would join the Pelicans with six players on the Top 100 list. Without Durant, though, the Nets are adding Kyrie Irving to a talented young core that challenged a Philadelphia 76ers team in the first round of the playoffs last season. Subbing in Irving in place of D'Angelo Russell will give the Nets more star power, as well as a proven winner who already has a championship on his resume. Harris is coming off a season where he led the league in 3-point percentage, while Caris LeVert has barely scratched the surface on what he's capable of becoming.


Nuggets
Top 100 Players: Nikola Jokic (10), Jamal Murray (40), Paul Millsap (51), Gary Harris (59), Jerami Grant (95)

The Nuggets were underestimated all season, and played their way into the No. 2 seed in the West behind the efforts of All-Star Nikola Jokic. Denver traded for Jerami Grant in the offseason for a first-round pick, providing it with another scoring option who just came off a career year with the Thunder, averaging 13 points and five rebounds a game. The Nuggets could have six players on this list by the time the 2020-21 season starts, depending on how Michael Porter Jr. fares in what will be his first season, after sitting out his entire rookie year. The West might be getting tougher and tougher every year, but Denver is bringing back a majority of its roster and looking to make a deeper run in the postseason. 


Rockets
Top 100 Players: James Harden (6), Russell Westbrook (19), Clint Capela (56), Eric Gordon (69), P.J. Tucker (70)

The Rockets will have to figure out how James Harden and Russell Westbrook fit together in a Mike D'Antoni offense, but for the time being they've got two of the top 20 guys in the league in their backcourt, and few teams have that. D'Antoni has been known to bring the best out of players, and if Russ buys into the system, the Rockets might be able to challenge the top teams in the West. If not, they'll be back in the same position they've been in for years.  


Clippers
Top 100 Players: Kawhi Leonard (2), Paul George (8), Lou Williams (50), Montrezl Harrell (78), Patrick Beverley (80)

A fully healthy Clippers squad is arguably the best team in the entire league. Paul George will be out until some point in November -- and that's being optimistic -- after having surgery on both shoulders in the offseason. Even without George, though, the Clippers will still have Kawhi Leonard, who already announced that he wants to play the entire season. We won't know what this Clippers team is capable of until George is back to 100 percent. When that happens, Leonard may become the first player to win an NBA championship with three different teams.


76ers
Top 100 Players: Joel Embiid (7), Ben Simmons (21), Al Horford (29), Tobias Harris (41), Josh Richardson (63)

That Game 7 loss to the Raptors last season may just fuel the 76ers for the entire season to get to the Eastern Conference finals. Joel Embiid will be the healthiest he's ever been in his career. Ben Simmons actually said he'll take a 3-point shot if it's a good look, and Philly added the only man that's been capable of stopping Embiid in Al Horford. They lost some shooting with the departures of JJ Redick and Jimmy Butler, but getting a young player like Josh Richardson in return is a bonus. 


Raptors
Top 100 Players: Pascal Siakam (28), Kyle Lowry (34), Marc Gasol (65), Fred VanVleet (88), Serge Ibaka (97)

The Raptors could be a very different team after the trade deadline. Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka are all on expiring contracts, and unless Toronto wants to extend any one of those aging players a contract past next year, it'd be wise to trade them in order to get something in return. Pascal Siakam is the next player the Raptors must try to build around, and he'll be playing for that max contract this season, so Toronto better start thinking about the next few years instead of the upcoming season.


Jazz
Top 100 Players: Rudy Gobert (17), Mike Conley (24), Donovan Mitchell (27), Joe Ingles (66), Bojan Bogdanovic (72)

Utah upgraded at the point guard position by swapping out Ricky Rubio for Mike Conley, and adding Bojan Bogdanovic to its bench. The Jazz are as rock solid as they come on defense, but in order for this team to survive the first round of the playoffs they'll need Donovan Mitchell to take that leap into becoming an All-Star-caliber player.

Teams with four players in the Top 100

Bulls
Top 100 Players: Lauri Markkanen (75), Zach LaVine (77), Otto Porter Jr. (81), Thaddeus Young (87)

Surprisingly, the Bulls have a lot of young talented players, but that hasn't translated into wins yet. Getting Otto Porter Jr. for a full season will provide some much-needed production, and adding Thaddeus Young to play the veteran leader to this group of 20-somethings was a smart move by franchise. This team hinges on the development of players like Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen to step up and become the cornerstone pieces in Chicago. With their sights set on the playoffs, Bulls fans may see competitive basketball played on a nightly basis for the first time in what feels like forever.


Warriors
Top 100 Players: Stephen Curry (3), Draymond Green (12), Klay Thompson (26), D'Angelo Russell (44)

The Avengers of NBA teams may be no more, but the Warriors still have Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and --depending on his rehab -- a semi-healthy Klay Thompson. Without Thompson in the lineup until at least the All-Star break, this Golden State team is still a playoff team. The fit of D'Angelo Russell raises a lot of questions. He may soon be a trade piece for the Warriors if it doesn't work out, but don't count them out this season. Curry could very well produce another historic season on his way to yet another MVP trophy.


Pacers
Top 100 Players: Victor Oladipo (25), Myles Turner (42), Malcolm Brogdon (62), Domantas Sabonis (71)

The Pacers only got so far without Victor Oladipo in the playoffs last year. While they won't have him for a large portion of the season, they did add Malcolm Brogdon from Milwaukee. Indiana is fortunate to be in the East, where it should be just fine without Oladipo, though it's a completely different team without him on the floor.


Heat
Top 100 Players: Jimmy Butler (14), Justise Winslow (82), Goran Dragic (92), Bam Adebayo (98)

The Miami Heat are interesting again after trading for Jimmy Butler. The Heat -- like most teams in the East -- are lucky to be in the weaker conference, because while they do have a solid crop of talent, their starting five would not be any better than the eighth-best team in the West. If the Heat do pull off a trade for Chris Paul, though, they would automatically be vaulted into the conversation as one of the top teams in the East. 


Bucks
Top 100 Players: Giannis Antetokounmpo (4), Khris Middleton (30), Eric Bledsoe (47), Brook Lopez (49)

The Bucks have the reigning MVP, and last season is likely the worse we'll ever see of Giannis. They took a hit when they let Malcolm Brogdon walk to Indiana, but they made the smart move in signing Khris Middleton to an extension. This season is as much about getting to the Finals as it is about making sure Giannis feels he can win a championship with this franchise before his impending free agency in 2021. 


Thunder
Top 100 Players: Chris Paul (31), Danilo Gallinari (46), Steven Adams (57), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (93)

After shipping off Russell Westbrook and Paul George, the Thunder are left with enough draft picks to field a whole team, along with talented assets like Gallinari and Gilgeous-Alexander. Oh, and the remainder of Chris Paul's hefty contract. Depending on what Oklahoma City does with Chris Paul will define its season; will it try to make a run at a playoff spot, or ship Paul off somewhere else and collect the reward?


Kings
Top 100 Players: De'Aaron Fox (38), Buddy Hield (64), Marvin Bagley (74), Harrison Barnes (89)

Sacramento was nine games back from sneaking into the playoffs last season, and will return largely the same team to take another step toward becoming a playoff contender. De'Aaron Fox took a huge leap last season after having an average rookie year, and Buddy Hield has thrived as Sacramento's go-to guy. One name not on the Top 100 list who could very well be there next year is Bogdan Bogdanovic. He had an amazing summer playing in the FIBA World Cup, and if used correctly in the Kings' system, could be their secret weapon off the bench.

Teams with three players in the Top 100

Lakers
Top 100 Players: LeBron James (1), Anthony Davis (5), Danny Green (90)

The Lakers finally got their second star to pair with LeBron. Only problem, they lack depth throughout the rest of the roster. Kyle Kuzma was the last man standing after the trade package that landed Anthony Davis, and he's not even on the Top 100 list. If LeBron is healthy, and Davis can mesh well with him, the Lakers will be a tough team to beat in the playoffs. If neither one of those guys can stay healthy, then it's another year watching postseason basketball at home for the NBA's most polarizing franchise.


Magic
Top 100 Players: Nikola Vucevic (35), Aaron Gordon (54), Jonathan Isaac (96)

Orlando shocked everyone and made it to the playoffs last season for the first time since 2012. The Magic are returning a majority of their team, and added a couple pieces that could make them a consistent playoff team for years to come. This team is so young and filled with untapped potential that there's a possibility the Magic could have a few more players on the Top 100 list next year.


Spurs
Top 100 Players: LaMarcus Aldridge (36), DeMar DeRozan (43), Derrick White (73)

Every year the Spurs are supposed to be ""done,"" they string together another winning season and are back in the playoffs. Even last year, when they were bitten by the injury bug, San Antonio prevailed and made the postseason. With those injured players set to return this year, and Gregg Popovich still calling the shots, it doesn't look like the Spurs will be going anywhere anytime soon.

Teams with two players in the Top 100

Hawks
Top 100 Players: Trae Young (45), John Collins (58)

The Hawks are an incredibly young team, and because of that only have Trae Young and John Collins on the Top 100 list. In a couple years, they could also add Kevin Huerter, De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish to the list. Atlanta likely won't crack the top eight teams in the East this year, but it will definitely be a team to watch on a Tuesday night when there's nothing else on.


Mavericks
Top 100 Players: Luka Doncic (22), Kristaps Porzingis (33)

A lot of what the Mavericks could become hinges on the health of Kristaps Porzingis. Dallas doesn't have a cabinet full of young talent like the Hawks or Pelicans, and it doesn't have that proven superstar to anchor the team. Luka Doncic had a near-perfect rookie season, and if he continues to rise to become what many expect to be an MVP-caliber player, then Dallas won't have an issue building around him. If Porzingis can't stay on the court, then that max deal will look grim in a few years. This season is a lot of ""wait, and see what happens"" for the Mavericks, but if everything goes according to plan, then Dallas will have one of the best young duos for years to come.


Pistons
Top 100 Players: Blake Griffin (18), Andre Drummond (60)

The Detroit Pistons are fueled by Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. They added Derrick Rose to give those two some help, but at the end of the day, the Pistons will only go as far as their talented bigs will take them. Which apparently, is a four-game sweep in the first round of the playoffs.


Grizzlies
Top 100 Players: Jaren Jackson Jr. (52), Jonas Valanciunas (94)

After trading Mike Conley to Utah, the Memphis Grizzlies are officially post grit-n-grind era. Now, they've got a talented young duo in Jaren Jackson Jr. and rookie Ja Morant, who could very well crack this list as soon as next year. The Grizzlies are planning for the long-term future for the first time in a while, and with the return they received from the Conley trade, it ensures that they'll at least remain interesting and competitive for the 2019-20 season.


Timberwolves
Top 100 Players: Karl-Anthony Towns (11), Robert Covington (68)

Once again, the Timberwolves made no significant moves to put them any closer to becoming a consistent playoff team. Karl-Anthony Towns had to watch as his close friend D'Angelo Russell was whisked away to the Bay Area after Minnesota couldn't get a deal done to bring the point guard to Minneapolis. The bright side, however, is the Wolves have assets they could use to get Towns some help. It may not be this season, but give it another year and Minnesota could be a functioning team again.


Suns
Top 100 Players: Devin Booker (32), Deandre Ayton (86)

At the very least, the Suns will be competitive for the first time in a very long time. Devin Booker is a borderline All-Star, and Deandre Ayton put together a solid rookie season. Phoenix finally addressed its point guard issue by adding Ricky Rubio, and trading for Dario Saric on draft night was a smart move for a team that lacks any real talent around Booker. The Suns won't be challenging for a playoff spot this season, but they'll look competent, and that's a start.


Trail Blazers
Top 100 Players: Damian Lillard (9), CJ McCollum (23)

Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum -- but largely Lillard -- willed this Portland team to the Western Conference finals last year. Always the underdog, the Trail Blazers will look to prove their critics wrong again with a slightly different team in an even tougher conference.

One player included in the Top 100

Cavaliers
Top 100 Player: Kevin Love (39)

Similar to his days in Minnesota, Kevin Love is again the only All-Star on the Cavaliers, although it looks like Cleveland is looking past Love and focusing on its young guard duo of Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. Cleveland is just a few moves away from leaning all the way into a rebuild, but for the time being, this is Love's team to lead.


Knicks
Top 100 Player: Julius Randle (85)

The Knicks' big plans to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving didn't come to fruition, and instead they pivoted to signing Julius Randle and a few other forwards to add to the mix. They didn't commit themselves to any long-term, pricey contracts, but how many times will we hear that ""this is the summer"" before the Knicks actually sign an All-Star?


Wizards
Top 100 Player: Bradley Beal (13)

The NBA season could quickly shift depending on if the Wizards look to deal Bradley Beal. Right now, it doesn't look like they're interested in that, but anything can happen over the course of the season. John Wall won't be brought back until he's 100 percent from an Achilles injury, so Washington will once again be competing with the Knicks and Hornets as the worst team in the East.

The only team without a player in the Top 100

Hornets
For years, the Hornets could count on Kemba Walker as their lone representative on any top players list. Instead of trading Walker to ensure they received something in return, Charlotte opted to let him walk free. Then, in an odd move, the Hornets signed Terry Rozier to be the new face of the franchise, because they had to give someone that money. The Hornets should start making their draft boards for the next few years, because barring some huge deal to land them some young talent, this team will be headed to the lottery for the foreseeable future."
"Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan among most interesting candidates to sign extensions before start of regular season

Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors agreed to a one-year, $31 million extension on Monday, a deal that makes so much sense that I almost don't want to say anything about it. (But I will: That's a hefty single-season salary for a player who will turn 35 late in the 2020-21 season, and yet it works for the Raptors because it all but guarantees they will remain competitive until the summer of 2021, at which point they will have all sorts of cap room.) 

In the next two weeks, there could be several more extensions like Lowry's or none at all. Here's a look at the most interesting candidates ahead of the Oct. 21 deadline, which applies to rookie-scale contract extensions and veteran extensions on contracts that have more than one year remaining:

A three-year, $111 million extension has been on the table since the moment the Washington Wizards were allowed to offer it to Beal, but he has not signed it. The Wizards are entering what Beal called a ""development year,"" and the 26-year-old isn't sure how quickly they will return to relevance. Beal told The Athletic's Fred Katz that his decision is not about money; it is about winning. 

""It's gonna be one of those types of years,"" Beal said. ""So, does Bradley Beal wanna be a part of that ultimately? And that's something I have to ask myself and something I'm probably still not done asking myself. So, I'm gonna use all my time until I can.""

You're familiar with this type of story: Beal is at the point in his career where stars typically want to compete for championships, and the team that drafted him cannot offer him that. Washington can say he's not available in trades, and Beal can say he's open to sticking around, but if he does not accept the extension, everybody around the league will speculate about his future.


Prediction: No extension. It would be an unbelievable feat if the Wizards were to convince him to commit, as their future is murky at best and there is no financial incentive for him. Beal can sign a more lucrative deal by waiting, regardless of whether or not he qualifies for a super-max extension next summer. I'd be shocked if he signed it and somewhat surprised if he is still on the roster after the trade deadline, as I could see a bidding war developing.

At media day, Raptors president Masai Ujiri did not seem particularly worried about when Siakam will sign a long-term deal. ""Whether it's going to be this fall or this summer, he's definitely someone we're going to keep here,"" Ujiri told reporters. The reigning Most Improved Player is about to have more offensive responsibility than anyone ever imagined, and, as long as he doesn't squander that opportunity or suffer a serious injury, he will be in line for a maximum contract as a restricted free agent in 2020.

There is an argument that Toronto should simply offer him the max right now, both as a good-faith gesture and to avoid having to deal with an unfavorable offer sheet. Such a move would not be atypical for a player as talented as Siakam, but it would hamper Toronto's financial flexibility next July. Since Siakam was drafted No. 27 overall in 2016, he will have only a $7 million cap hold until he puts pen to paper. 

Prediction: No extension. The Lowry news means that, if Toronto wants to have as many options as possible next summer, Siakam's relatively small cap hold is important. Giving him the max before the start of the season would essentially mean turning down $22 million in cap space, per The Athletic's Blake Murphy, and that's difficult to justify. It is equally difficult to imagine Siakam wanting the immediate payday so badly that he would be willing to accept significantly less than the max.

DeRozan and the Spurs have reportedly discussed an extension, but there has been no indication that a deal is close. ""However it unfolds, that's how it is supposed to unfold,"" DeRozan said at media day, per the San Antonio Express-News' Tom Orsborn, sounding at peace with his somewhat tenuous contract situation. 

If DeRozan does not sign an extension, he can either become a free agent in July or pick up his $27.7 million player option for 2020-21. If he does sign one, the maximum the Spurs can pay him is about $150 million over four years, which is an enormous amount of money but less than he could make on a max deal signed in the offseason.

There are so many variables here. How do the Spurs value DeRozan? How far away do they think they are from contention? How eager is he to explore free agency? San Antonio is loaded with young guards -- Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Lonnie Walker -- and, for now, it appears to be trying to transition into a new era without dropping out of the playoffs. The Spurs could decide to fully commit to their youth movement, but they could also decide to make a win-now trade. DeRozan could even be a part of a win-now trade. 

Prediction: No extension. Almost no outcome would shock me, but I suspect that any contract that he finds acceptable would also be a contract that they find too risky.

Discussions have begun on a possible extension, Brown told the Boston Sports Journal's Brian Robb, but nobody seems to think they will reach an agreement, per the Boston Globe's Gary Washburn. Brown, who doesn't have an agent, can credibly argue that he deserves the max or something close to it because of his upside and the way he has contributed to a winning team. The Celtics, though, can counter that, as much as they love his defense, versatility and potential, he has to make progress as a playmaker and shooter in order to earn that kind of commitment.

If Brown does not sign an extension, this is obviously a prove-it season, both in terms of his individual development and how he fits next to Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward and Jayson Tatum. Is it even possible for Brown to grow into a max-type player next to two like-sized wings and a point guard who is accustomed to having the ball in his hands? I can't definitively say no, but he is not in the best position to show what he's been working on offensively. 

Prediction: No extension. Boston is typically fine with letting its players hit restricted free agency, and, barring a massive hometown discount, it would be smart to see how the team looks before making a decision about Brown.

I've heard a hypothetical Sabonis-for-Brown swap discussed on every NBA podcast in existence, as the Pacers big man might be better off on a team that doesn't also employ center Myles Turner. Indiana extended Turner a year ago, and Sabonis admitted he was ""shocked at first"" when it drafted yet another center, Goga Bitadze, this past summer in an interview with 15min's Donatas Urbonas. Sabonis also said he gets it, he knows he can play with Turner and he expects to sign an extension. Hmm. 


Indiana has made it clear that it will give Sabonis and Turner a chance to prove the two-big look can work. Naming them starters, though, is not the same as making long-term financial commitments to both of them, especially when it is unclear if an extension in the four-year, $70-to-80 million range, like Turner's, would be enough to keep Sabonis. Would they hesitate to pay him more than Turner?

Prediction: Extension. Sabonis' $10.6 million cap hold next summer is less than what his 2020-21 salary will be, but I'm not sure the difference is enough for Indiana to risk having to deal with a prohibitively expensive offer sheet. If Sabonis is willing to accept a contract in the neighborhood of Turner's, I can see the Pacers happily extending him and being confident that both bigs will be tradeable if the experiment fails.

Drummond could become a free agent in 2020 by turning down his $28.8 million player option, or he and Detroit could work out an extension. According to the Detroit Free Press' Vince Ellis, Drummond's reps have tried to start a conversation with the team about a possible extension, but Drummond is on the record saying he is excited about being a free agent.

Pistons owner Tom Gores fielded a question about an extension on Monday, per the Associated Press' Noah Trister, but dodged it, saying that the organization wants to keep Drummond. ""We know how dedicated we are to each other,"" Gores said, without directly addressing the subject.


Prediction: No extension. Drummond, still just 26, surely believes he will get another massive contract wherever he goes after this season, assuming he opts out, and he might want a fresh start if Detroit misses the playoffs. I'm not sure there's a compelling reason for the Pistons to rush on this, either.

Tucker will turn 35 during the 2019-20 playoffs, and only $2.6 million of his $8 million salary is guaranteed the following season. In August, he told The Athletic's Kelly Iko that he was ""optimistic"" about an extension, which would require Houston to guarantee the full $8 million and then add one year (for a maximum of $11.4 million because that is 120 percent of the league's average salary -- the CBA is weird) or two years (for a maximum of $24 million). 

If the Rockets could be sure that Tucker will fend off Father Time, then an extension would be awesome for them. He is a perfect fit in their offense because he doesn't need the ball and loves shooting corner 3s, and he is one of the best defenders in the league. Given Tucker's age, though, the safer plan is to keep their options open.

Prediction: No extension. I might have guessed that he'd get a one-year extension or at least get his 2020-21 salary guaranteed, but, in a recent interview with the Houston Chronicle's Jonathan Feigen, general manager Daryl Morey said that ""I wouldn't expect any other extension from us"" after reaching an agreement with Eric Gordon.

With the 2020 free-agent class looking weak, it's not crazy to imagine him asking for the max (four years, around $131 million, assuming the Kings do not make him a designated player and give him an extra year) or something like it. That seems like an overpay, especially because we now know he turned 24 in his rookie season. 

Prediction: Extension. I bet it's not the max, but it's enough for Sacramento to take some criticism.

He is worth far more than that, and he should have all sorts of suitors in restricted free agency, all of whom know that Sacramento can't pay everybody. 

Prediction: No extension. And while I don't endorse the idea of a trade, one wouldn't surprise me.

This is a fascinating one. Ingram, 22, is far from a finished product, and his 2018-19 season is tricky to evaluate because of how weird the Lakers were. He has obvious star potential, but desperately needs to improve as a shooter and the Pelicans might want to see how their new team jells before making a big investment in him.

Prediction: No extension. Waiting means risking that Ingram has a true breakout and his price tag skyrockets, which would be less than ideal. The alternative, though, means risking that he stagnates or doesn't fit, which could be disastrous.

Murray was named All-Defense in the first season that he played regular minutes, and the Spurs thought he would make a leap on the other end before he tore his ACL exactly a year ago. San Antonio could be cautious because of the injury and the fact he hasn't tested his supposedly improved jumper against regular-season competition, or it could see this as an opportunity to get a discount (and take some pressure off him). 

Prediction: No extension. The Spurs should try to lock him up now, but Murray should bet on himself.

The Nuggets have a logjam on the wing, and Beasley is in an awkward spot: definitely good enough to have a steady role, but not good enough to separate himself from all the other guys. He turned down a three-year, $30 million extension offer, per ESPN's Bobby Marks, and then switched agents, signing with Rich Paul and Klutch Sports. 

Prediction: No extension. Denver's depth is nice, but it is not sustainable. If Beasley is still on the team after the February deadline, I bet another wing has been either traded or injured.

The Nets are gushing about Prince's shooting, and he is saying all the right things about defending the way he did when he came into the league. If he can consistently be the best version of himself on both ends, then Brooklyn has itself the exact type of role player it needs. That's a big if, though.

"A statue of former Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been built in his hometown in Sweden.

The bronze structure, commissioned by the Swedish FA, was unveiled in front of hundreds of fans outside Malmo's stadium on Tuesday.

""No matter where you come from, where you are, no matter what you look like, the statue is the symbol that anything is possible,"" said Ibrahimovic.

The 38-year-old scored 62 goals in 116 games for Sweden between 2001 and 2016.

The statue, created by Swedish artist Peter Linde, is 8ft 9in tall and weighs almost 500kg.

Ibrahimovic started his career with Malmo before going on to play for Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan, Paris St-Germain and United.

He moved to the United States to play in the MLS in 2018.

Former England captain David Beckham, Portugal and Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo and Liverpool's Egypt striker Mohamed Salah have been honoured with statues.

There is also an Ibrahimovic effigy at the Grevin wax museum in Paris"
"Inge Matteeusen and Magali de Cooman soak up the atmosphere as they shuffle along Goodison Road, decked out in freshly-bought blue merchandise.

Having travelled to Merseyside from Belgium for a long weekend, they were originally keen to see Liverpool play, but the Reds weren't at home so the Toffees are reaping the benefit.

""This is our first game in England,"" says Inge. ""We have come to Liverpool to see the city but coming to a football game was always going to be a part of our trip.""

""Liverpool weren't at home but we saw Everton were playing Manchester City,"" adds Magali. ""And Everton have the same colours as our local team Gent, so we are happy in blue anyway.""

And with that they depart, proudly sporting their newly-acquired colours. They'll return to Belgium on Monday but will take a little bit of Goodison Park with them.

Football tourism is a booming industry and there is currently no hotter destination than the Premier League.

The most recent study of the economic and social impact of England's top-flight, conducted by EY for the 2016-17 season, showed 686,000 people came to the country for the purpose of visiting one of its clubs and spent £555m during their stay - numbers that will surely only be boosted by English sides' recent European success.

Having this year confirmed the Premier League's power as a driver of inbound tourism via its own study, it is no surprise to find VisitBritain's website prominently offering visitors the chance to plan a football pilgrimage.

For most, the trip is a labour of love.

Every week, hundreds of official supporters' group members travel to England - some regulars, others embracing the rare opportunity to see their side in the flesh.

Most groups will have an arrangement with their Premier League club for a set amount of tickets over the year to share among their members, with some larger groups possessing a small number of season tickets.

They are the loyalists - committed overseas fans, who possess all of the knowledge and fervour of their English peers, just not the geographical fortune.

They also stand in stark contradiction to the stereotype of overseas fans with a half and half scarf wrapped round their neck and no true affinity in their heart.

There's Ryan Hayman, chairman of the 1,500-strong Boston Spurs, who helps cater for Tottenham fans across New England and whose own five expensive and lengthy journeys to England have included seeing his side beat Leicester 5-4, face north London rivals Arsenal and witness the opening of the new White Hart Lane in person.

The New York Blues, whose founding members have been attending Chelsea games since before 1990, had one of its 250 members at every home game last season.

""We have had members support them on the Continent from Baku to Moscow, Barcelona to Munich, as well as throughout England, from title-clinching goals at West Brom to providing many people with their first London experience,"" they told BBC Sport.

There's Thanos Oktoratos, secretary of the Greek official supporters branch for Manchester United in Athens, his fellow Red Devil, Dr Souyma Dasgupta of the Kolkata club, Jeffrey Werner, secretary of Arsenal America, the Zhengzhou Cityzens, Aussie Hammers, IndoEvertonians and many, many more.

The South Africa branch of the Manchester United supporters' club have four season tickets but have arranged for larger parties to attend the final game of the season since 1998.

Secretary Ethel Sleith told BBC Sport: ""A few years ago I had a call from a man whose father had been on the club trip just a few weeks prior.

""He told me that his father had died suddenly, and thanked me for affording him the opportunity of fulfilling his dream.""

There are a multitude of other reasons people are drawn to Premier League games - the speed, excitement and atmosphere or the fact games are now entertainment events akin to going to the theatre or a concert.

Some are driven less by their passion for a club and more by their affinity or admiration for a specific player - something Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus have benefitted from through the desire to witness Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the greatest players of their (and possibly any) generation.

Two other Belgians, Edgar and Thomas, made their way over for the Everton v Man City game, but their reason was a lot more specific - their compatriot Kevin de Bruyne.

""We both follow City because of Kevin, and before that Vincent Kompany as well,"" explains Thomas. ""There is a lot of pride back in Belgium about how well they are doing. We are a small country and at the moment we have some very good players in the Premier League.""

""I am a big diehard fan of City since Vincent Kompany came here,"" adds Edgar. ""We don't really have a Belgian team that we support as football at home is not as entertaining as the Premier League. The atmosphere here is great.""

Premier League clubs are wise to the global popularity of their product and the opportunities in front of them.

England's top division is broadcast to 212 territories and an audience in the billions.

What we currently have is a battle for territory amongst the league's top sides as illustrated by the destination of the 'big six' on their pre-season tours: Arsenal and Liverpool (United States), Chelsea (Japan), Manchester City (China and Japan), Manchester United (Australia, Singapore and China) and Tottenham (Singapore and China).

Within this, there are areas of particular appeal to certain clubs.

Tottenham are savvy to their increased status in South Korea, having appointed a brand management company in 2016 to help them capitalise on their growing popularity in the country as a result of their forward Son Heung-min.

But the most ambitious are after the world.

Manchester City's parent company, the City Football Group, have seven clubs and 12 offices in key markets across the world, as part of a plan to transport the club from Greater Manchester to the globe - a process referred to by sports business consultants as ""glocalisation"".

Authenticity is a key word. City have nine international websites and social media accounts in 13 languages, including Thai, Indonesian, Mandarin, Spanish and Portuguese, which they are ""constantly temperature checking"" to make them relevant to their intended market, in part through locally based content producers.

Like many clubs, they also stage fan engagement activities around the world, including match day screenings, pre-season tours, friendlies and community projects. The club are currently midway through a global tour, visiting 12 countries with the six pieces of silverware they won last season, and hosting fan events featuring ex-players Paul Dickov, Micah Richards and Shaun Wright-Phillips.

And it is not just the clubs coining it in.

Independent merchandise sellers at grounds have been quick to respond to the desires of overseas fans, including the increased stocking of those divisive half and half scarves.

""I've been doing this for 15 years and there's definitely been an increase in football fans from overseas,"" Graham Anderson, a seller outside Goodison Park, tells BBC Sport.

""Whether it is Everton or Liverpool at home they come to see the city - that's a big sell for them - and even if they are not going to watch the actual game they come to check out the stalls and soak up the atmosphere.

""They come from all over. We get lots from Iceland and America while badges and the scarves are popular with fans from China and Japan.

""We don't get the locals buying the half and half scarves and they do cause quite a bit of upset among fans but I find the overseas fans like to buy them to mark the game they've come to see. It's not always easy or affordable to travel over so they want to mark it.""

So why is the notion of the ""football tourist"" such an anathema to some fans?

The big issue is that demand for tickets often outstrips supply at Premier League clubs, even those with the biggest grounds. Loyal fans fear they will be forced out by casual visitors, who possess no real connection to the club but possess deeper pockets and a bucket list to tick off.

Liverpool is a club with a strong global following, based in a city that attracts many tourists, some of whom will be drawn to Anfield less out of love or loyalty and more the chance to say they had sampled its famed atmosphere.

""For me, one of Liverpool's greatest strengths comes from not just having a global fanbase, but how much effort those fans expend in engaging in the local culture and matchday customs,"" Paul Machin, host of Redmen TV, told BBC Sport.

""Any issue with 'Football Tourism' comes from people who are perhaps on a holiday to Liverpool, have no affinity with the club or interest in the matchday culture and treat a day at the match as a line on a tick list of things to do, like visiting the Beatle Story, or going on a Ferry Across the Mersey.

""When hardcore fans (whether local or otherwise) are not able to get to games, yet casual tourists (who often can afford to pay well over the odds) get those seats, it causes friction.""

The Kop at Anfield
Anfield is a popular destination for visitors to Liverpool
For clubs, it is about balance - catering for as many people as possible, spreading the word and selling shirts but respecting and rewarding their loyal base.

Lizzi Doyle, another Liverpool fan and producer of the Anfield Wrap podcast, told BBC Sport: ""On one part, Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world and that comes with global supporters.

""It's because of these supporters that we are as renowned as we are, and I love seeing the pre-season tours in America, Asia and Australia, with fully sold out stadiums. It makes me prouder to be from Liverpool and supporting this wonderful club.

""Clubs have a big responsibility to local and match-going fans and it has to go beyond money and needs to be about loyalty in this ever-changing world of modern football.

""They are the lifeblood. If it weren't for their dads, grandfathers, great grandmothers, etc, introducing this way of life to them, Anfield wouldn't have the famous atmosphere it does now, which attracts overseas fans and makes us the global club we are.

""We couldn't be Liverpool FC without either sets of fans."""
"It is Manchester United's worst start to a season for 30 years.

The club are 12th in the Premier League, with nine points from eight games. They have not won away from Old Trafford in domestic competition since February and have failed to score more than one goal in any game since the 4-0 opening-day hammering of Chelsea.

United will spend the next two weeks sitting an uncomfortable two points above the relegation zone.

Next up are arch rivals and Premier League leaders Liverpool, who require one more victory to equal Manchester City's record 18 Premier League wins in a row.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is putting on a brave face and only last month, United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said patience was required as the club tried to recapture past glories.

But as striker Marcus Rashford tweeted on Monday, there is no hiding in football. So is Solskjaer really safe? Will Woodward stick with this current position and give the Norwegian time? And even if he does, is there any sign United's miserable season is going to get any better?

Man Utd displays unacceptable - De Gea
More sorry statistics
Solskjaer was given the job of replacing Jose Mourinho on a permanent basis on 28 March.

He had lost one of his first 17 games in temporary charge and had a win percentage of 82.35%.

Fast forward seven months and the backdrop could not be much more bleak. A total of 14 points from their past 15 games is better only than Southampton (13), Brighton (12) and Watford (10) of the 14 clubs who have been in the Premier League throughout his time in charge.

Solskjaer's win ratio now is 47.5% - the worst of any United manager since Dave Sexton, who was in charge from 1977-81.

United are two points above the relegation zone. It is unlikely, but not impossible, they could be in it after the ninth round of matches has been completed. The last time they were in the bottom three after more than a single game was 1992-93, when they were 20th (out of 22) after three matches. They went on to win the title that season. No-one is seriously contemplating that outcome at the end of this campaign.

United have not won away from home in the Premier League since they beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 27 February. The eight games they have gone without a victory since then is their worst run since 1989.

Their shot conversion rate in the Premier League this season is 8.2%, the fifth worst in the top flight.

United have won one out of their past eight meetings with Liverpool, although five of them have ended in draws.


Marcus Rashford

You canít hide in football and the last few weeks simply havenít been good enough.

As a United fan myself, that hurts. And you deserve better.

We know we need to improve and that is our sole focus as a team and as a club.

This was a light-hearted response from a United staff member to a situation acknowledged to be hugely difficult to navigate.

Yet there is an element of truth behind the flippancy.

For the opening two games of the season, the victory against Chelsea and a draw at Wolves when United were the better side and would probably have won if Paul Pogba had converted a penalty, Solskjaer made one change; swapping Andreas Pereira for new signing Daniel James.

In the third game - a home defeat by Crystal Palace - left-back Luke Shaw suffered a hamstring injury and hasn't played since. That match is also the last time Anthony Martial has played for United after sustaining a thigh injury in training.

At Newcastle, Solskjaer's starting line-up contained only five players from the Chelsea game; goalkeeper David de Gea, midfielders Scott McTominay and Pereira, striker Marcus Rashford and £80m defender Harry Maguire, who headed United's best chance wide at St James' Park.

The feeling at the club is that if United can field a side similar to the one that played against Chelsea, including Pogba, who has missed five out of the past seven matches with an ankle injury, results and performances will improve.

'A quagmire of mediocrity'
This was a real quote, from a United staff member, to sum up what they thought of the current situation.

Solskjaer, it was stressed, was not to blame for this. It was just what the speaker felt was an honest assessment of the club's squad at the present time.

Sources have told the BBC that Solskjaer's initial view after replacing Mourinho was that United needed to change nine players.

So far, three have left, plus Alexis Sanchez and Chris Smalling on loan. In addition, Marouane Fellaini left for China in February and Antonio Valencia, who played twice under Solskjaer, was not offered a new contract.

It has been stressed by multiple United staff members that keeping strikers Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez would have been counter-productive because the pair had made it known they no longer wished to be at the club. Neither played a single match in pre-season before they joined Inter Milan.

Solskjaer was keen to make further signings but a combination of the correct players not being available, the inability to get unwanted players out of the club to create space and asking prices being deemed to be too high made it impractical.

As an example, United were keen to sign Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff. However, when they approached the Magpies, they were told the asking price was £50m.

When it was pointed out this was a huge amount for a 21-year-old who had made only 13 senior appearances for Newcastle, the reply was that United had just paid the same fee to Crystal Palace for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who was the same age and had played 46 times for his club.

United opted to walk away.

While there is obvious frustration among the coaching staff at this course of action, United do not have limitless funds, despite being one of the world's richest clubs.

It does, however, shine a light once again on the club's major transfer negotiator, head of corporate development Matt Judge, and his ability to do deals. Woodward has previously defended the recruitment team and structure but one agent - who has been trying to arrange a loan deal for a client - has rather cruelly suggested Judge should be going out on loan to further his experience.

Solskjaer's obvious problem is the lack of movement in the summer leaves him with a number of players he feels are not up to the demands of a being United player - either mentally or through ability. The injury issues have pushed them further to the forefront of the squad.

Against Newcastle, as in other recent games, periods of decent football were mixed with a bewildering inability to put together effective passing moves.

There is also a feeling some longer-serving players have become weary because of the club's various issues since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and now lack the confidence to drag themselves out of the malaise.

Mason Greenwood
Mason Greenwood, then 17, became Manchester United's youngest scorer in Europe last month against Astana in the Europa League
The youngsters
Solskjaer has repeatedly talked up the crop of youngsters in which he is placing such faith.

Last month, he said 18-year-old forward Mason Greenwood was ""one of the best finishers I have seen"".

Behind the scenes, United's coaching staff know they are asking too much of Greenwood, Tahith Chong, Angel Gomes and Brandon Williams. They note Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori - who have all excelled for Chelsea this season - have had two or three loan spells away from Stamford Bridge to further their footballing education.

Abraham, who has scored eight Premier League goals this season and was 22 on 2 October, is four weeks older than Marcus Rashford, who is having to shoulder United's attacking responsibilities virtually on his own.

With the exception of Ryan Giggs, who was deemed a special case, Sir Alex Ferguson introduced the famed 'Class of '92' slowly and was not afraid to leave them out on occasion.

It was not until the 'You'll Never Win Anything With Kids' day, at the start of the 1995-96 season, that they were used regularly and within the same team.

The fear is United's youngsters will get so used to losing, it will become a hard habit to break.

What happens now?
A United source put the club's situation into stark perspective after Sunday's defeat at Newcastle: ""We just have to try and get to January.""

Club officials continue to state this is a notoriously difficult time to do transfer business and the doomed arrival of Sanchez from Arsenal in January 2018 underlines the pitfalls.

Yet, without additions, finishing in the top six looks impossible, let alone qualifying for the Champions League. If this is not achieved, it would trigger penalty clauses in sponsorship deals.

Solskjaer is certain players still want to join United. The key is getting the ones who have the right mental approach. It is something they managed in the summer but it must be repeated in January and next summer if the club are to make any progress.

The big question is whether United will stand by the 46-year-old if the present situation gets worse.

Uncertainty over Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham future has heightened social media debate about Solskjaer's abilities, although, for now, United fans attending matches are turning their ire towards the Glazer family who own the club rather than the man who manages it.

However, there is a very real fear from some inside the club that should Liverpool inflict a heavy defeat on United on 20 October, the external reaction may create pressure they find too hard to resist.

This would be regarded as unfair by those who feel Solskjaer's three signings have been positive additions but only represent the first phase of what needs to be achieved.

However, the alternate view is that Solskjaer is not up to the job and a defeat by Liverpool would merely confirm it.

Either way, the next two weeks are not going to be easy for anyone connected with Manchester United."
"Former Germany, Manchester United and Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has retired.

The 35-year-old announced his decision two days after the end of the Major League Soccer season. His club, Chicago Fire, finished 17th.

""The time has now come,"" he said. ""To the fans, you made this unbelievable time possible for me.""

Schweinsteiger won the 2014 World Cup with Germany, as well as eight Bundesliga titles with Bayern.

In total, he gained 121 caps for Germany between 2004 and 2016.

The midfielder played 500 times for Bayern - where he also won the Champions League - before joining Manchester United for £14.4m in 2015 but failed to adapt to the Premier League, making 13 league starts in two years.

He was made to train with the under-23s at Old Trafford by then manager Jose Mourinho - who later said he regretted his decision.

Schweinsteiger joined Chicago Fire on a free transfer in March 2017 and scored on his debut. Fire finished third in his first season to reach the play-offs but have struggled since.

'One of the greatest players in German history'
Bastian Schweinsteiger
Schweinsteiger is Germany's fourth-most capped player
Schweinsteiger played in seven consecutive major tournaments for Germany, guiding the team to a World Cup win, two other World Cup semi-finals, the final of Euro 2008 and the semi-finals of Euro 2012 and 2016.

""He is one of the greatest players in German history,"" said manager Joachim Low.

""We will always have a place for him with the national side. You could always feel his will to win. He was a great player and a great personality.""

Bastian Schweinsteiger
Schweinsteiger made 85 appearances for Chicago Fire
""Basti has meant so much to our club,"" said Chicago Fire chairman Joe Mansueto. ""It was an absolute pleasure to watch him play.

""His soccer IQ is so elite, you can see that he's three steps ahead at every turn. He's a leader, a great team-mate and a generational player who put Chicago Fire on the world map. I'd like to say, on behalf of the club: Danke, Basti.""

Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said ""the doors at Bayern are always open"" to their former player.

""A great career is coming to an end. Basti has won everything there is to win in world football,"" he said."
"Player welfare will be at risk if plans to change European club competitions go ahead, says the body representing leagues across the continent.

Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli wants to change the format of the Champions League and spoke about the issue at a leaders conference on Tuesday.

But Lars-Christer Olsson, president of European Leagues, is against the move and cited fixture pile-ups as an issue.

""It is becoming more evident we have to look after the players,"" Olsson said.

""If they are playing 70 or 80 matches a year, there is a high likelihood of them getting injured.""

Olsson's organisation - the Association of European Professional Football Leagues, also known as European Leagues - says it is the voice of professional football leagues across Europe on all matters of common interest.

He wants plans to change the Champions League format scrapped.

Champions League
The Champions League currently has eight groups of four teams
It has been suggested the competition could be changed from its current set-up - eight groups of four - to six groups of six. Such a move would increase the number of group-stage matches for each team from six to 10.

Olsson believes the only way of dealing with additional matches would be for clubs to expand their squads to 40 players but feels this would dilute the competition as a whole and, in any case, would benefit the richer clubs, something he is vehemently opposed to.

Agnelli has been canvassing opinion from Europe's clubs for a change in the current European model.

The Italian is yet to reach any consensus and used his speech, at the Leaders Sport Business Summit at Twickenham, to tell the leagues they had to stop saying ""no, no, no"" to a revision of the current system.

Agnelli argues that change has to happen if football is to remain interesting to a younger generation he believes will be attracted away by computer games such as Fortnite and League of Legends.

But Olsson said: ""It is a contradiction to say the clubs are fighting the leagues. All the clubs are in leagues and among the leagues there is no problem.""

Olsson says the leagues are against the present idea of incorporating promotion and relegation into European competitions, believing it would turn them into ""a closed shop"".

""It is completely non-negotiable,"" he said.

""If you win one tier, it makes sense you should get the chance to play at the next level and if you win the Champions League, you should be able to defend it, but those three teams are the only ones who should be given the opportunity to play in European club football the following season by right.

""The rest should be down to recent success on the pitch in a domestic league. Clubs should not have an advantage because of what they have done in the past.

""Neither do I think the big leagues - England, Spain, Italy and Germany - should have four teams who go straight into the group stages because it limits the opportunities for teams from other countries.

""It should be three and one into the qualifying round. If the fourth team is good enough, they will get through but someone else should have a chance of doing it as well.""

Liverpool
Liverpool played 13 matches to win last season's Champions League
Agnelli has set a deadline of autumn 2022 to come up with a new system, which can then be used as the basis for negotiations over the television deals scheduled to run from 2024.

He cited the expansion of the women's game as a reason why a solution must be found that will generate greater revenue for medium ranking European clubs in particular.

""The growth of the women's game has brought a breath of fresh air to the industry,"" he said.

""Clubs are finally realising the women's game is important and can be another source of potential consumers and fans.

""But it is difficult to ask a club from a medium or small-sized league to invest £2m - which is what you need from the start when you think about logistics, transport, hotels and salaries - out of an overall budget of £20m. It is the equivalent of a third division men's team."""
"Tammy Abraham says England are prepared to walk off the pitch if they are targeted by racist abuse in their Euro 2020 qualifiers this week.

England face the Czech Republic on Friday - then play Bulgaria on Monday in a partially-closed stadium because of fans' racist behaviour in June.

""If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us,"" Abraham said.

""Harry Kane even said that if we're not happy, if a player is not happy, we all come off the pitch together.""

Maddison in? Pick your England XI

Henderson gets called up
Uefa ordered the partial closure of Bulgaria's national stadium following racist behaviour by their fans in Euro 2020 qualifying games against the Czech Republic and Kosovo in June.

In August, Bulgarian club sides PFC Levski Sofia and PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv were punished by Uefa for racism during Europa League games.

England manager Gareth Southgate said last month that he would talk to the players before next week's game, and Abraham says the players have decided they will take matters into their own hands if necessary.

Uefa's three-step protocol for racial abuse ends with the officials abandoning a match if announcements inside a stadium do not stop the problem.

""We did speak about that [the protocol],"" Abraham said. ""Harry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game - no matter what the score is - if we're not happy with it, as a team we'll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.

""If it happens and let's say there's a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.""

Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold, 21, agreed the team should follow the protocols but added: ""If it does get extreme we may have to take a different action.

""It's a team decision, one that we all need to make. It doesn't matter if one player is abused or the team - we are one group.

""Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable on the pitch. Everyone should be given the chance to play in a fair environment. We are a team. If one person is abused then we all are, we are one big family.""

Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings says that it is ""disappointing"" to have to deal with racism in football in 2019 but echoed Southgate's comments from last year that England still has work to do on home soil.

Villa's 5-1 win at Norwich last Saturday was followed by the club saying they are ""disgusted and appalled"" by footage of supporters singing a racist song which references two first-team players.

""It highlights the fact that our own country isn't perfect,"" Mings told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""The fact that we talk about it [racism] in foreign countries, in other European countries that aren't necessarily as diverse is one thing, but there are issues going on in this country [England] as well, which is far from ideal.

""Both are issues that people should never get bored of talking about. If they are happening they have to be brought to light by people who have a voice like us. We have to address it, we have to get it right somehow.

""There have been great strides to try to eradicate racism from football. It's a society issue."""

But how is each group shaping up? From the runaway leaders to ties at the top, we look at the state of play going into October's qualifiersÖ

Group A - England aim to book finals spot
Coming up: October 11 - Czech Republic v England, Montenegro v Bulgaria; October 14 - Bulgaria v England, Kosovo v Montenegro

It's starting to look like a case of when, not if, for England. After an entertaining win over nearest-rivals Kosovo last time out, they already have a four-point cushion inside the qualification places and a game in hand.


Watch highlights of England's 5-3 win over Kosovo
A win over Czech Republic on Friday will seal their path to the finals, and they could guarantee top spot too if they do the double and beat Bulgaria next week - or Kosovo fail to take maximum points at home to Montenegro.

The second spot is much more up for grabs. Czech Republic are currently second but could be leapfrogged by Kosovo if they fail to beat England on October 11. Montenegro and Bulgaria, both winless with two points each, will need something approaching a miracle to finish inside the top two.

Cristiano Ronaldo once again proved that heís still at the very top of his game with another four goals for Portugal in their European Qualifier against Lithuania
Coming up: October 11 - Portugal v Luxembourg, Ukraine v Lithuania; October 14 - Ukraine v Portugal, Lithuania v Serbia

Life is looking pretty rosy at the top of Group B for Ukraine, who look set to qualify for their third Euro finals in a row. A win over Lithuania on Friday would all-but see them through; four more points would definitely be enough.

Portugal are far from assured of a chance to retain the trophy they won in France in 2016, but they do have a game in hand over third-placed Serbia and a win over minnows Luxembourg would give them some breathing space.

Luxembourg's unlikely shot at a place will be over with defeat to Portugal, while Lithuania must provide a huge shock in Ukraine if they want to keep their dreams alive.
Jamal Lewis has been named in the Northern Ireland squad despite an elbow injury
Coming up: October 10 - Netherlands v Northern Ireland, Belarus v Estonia; October 13 - Belarus v Netherlands, Estonia v Germany

Northern Ireland's perfect start was ripped apart by Germany last time out but Michael O'Neill's side still have their destiny in their own hands. A tough trip to the Netherlands, who have been back with a bang over the past 12 months, awaits on Thursday night but even defeat in that wouldn't be fatal, although it would be a bitter blow.

Leaders Germany could find themselves leapfrogged by Netherlands by the end of the international break, especially if they are held themselves by Estonia on Sunday, while Belarus must beat Estonia too to stand any outside chance.
David McGoldrick scored his first Ireland goal five years after his international debut against Switzerland
Coming up: October 12 - Georgia v Republic of Ireland, Denmark v Switzerland; October 15 - Switzerland v Republic of Ireland, Gibraltar v Georgia

Republic of Ireland look in good shape after their comeback draw with Switzerland last month and beating Georgia next time out would leave them in sterling shape, especially with nearest challengers Denmark and Switzerland going head-to-head on the same night.

Should Switzerland fail to win that one, if Ireland take maximum points in Georgia it would give them a chance to qualify on Sunday.

Georgia's surprise draw with Denmark last time out gave them their fourth point of qualifying, but they could be eliminated this weekend - worse news for Gibraltar, who have lost every game and are already out of contention.
Aaron Ramsey will be assessed ahead of Wales' Euro Qualifiers
Coming up: October 10 - Croatia v Hungary, Slovakia v Wales; October 13 - Hungary v Azerbaijan, Wales v Croatia

Wales might be fourth in Group E but things are not all as they seem. A win over second-placed Slovakia on Thursday would take them level with a game in hand, and with first and third going head-to-head on the same night it's near enough a must-win game for Ryan Giggs.

Croatia's blip against Hungary aside they've been pretty consistent up at the top, but there's a reason Hungary qualified for the last Euros and they're very much still in it with nine points from five games.

Azerbaijan are already out, despite an eye-catching draw with Croatia in September.
Group F - Spain set for finals
Coming up: October 12 - Faroe Islands v Romania, Norway v Spain, Malta v Sweden; October 15 - Sweden v Spain, Romania v Norway, Faroe Islands v Malta

Spain's perfect record has them as good as through and they can book their place in the finals this weekend.


Spain eased past Faroe Islands last time out
That aside second place is up in the air, with Sweden, Romania and Norway separated by two points with two games to go. Romania will be very pleased they're the only side of the three not to play Spain this weekend - and they host Norway next Tuesday in a game that could have big consequences.

Further down Malta and Faroe Islands are both way back, with only three points to show between them - although that will definitely change when they go head-to-head next Tuesday.

Group F
P	W	D	L	Pts
Spain	6	6	0	0	18
Sweden	6	3	2	1	11
Romania	6	3	1	2	10
Norway	6	2	3	1	9
Malta	6	1	0	5	3
Faroe Islands	6	0	0	6	0
Group G - It's tight at the top
Coming up: October 10 - Latvia v Poland, Austria v Israel, North Macedonia v Slovenia; October 13 - Poland v North Macedonia, Slovenia v Austria

It's all a little bit congested at the top of Group G, with only five points separating the top five teams. Poland, who are two points clear of Slovenia, have taken the bull by the horns and have pointless Latvia up next, so will be confident of earning at least one win this week.

Slovenia's run of three wins in a row has lifted them up to second but they have Austria, who are a point behind them, breathing down their necks.

North Macedonia and Israel are five points behind Poland, but with 12 points to play for from the final four games, they are still in contention for the qualification places.

Group G
P	W	D	L	Pts
Poland	6	4	1	1	13
Slovenia	6	3	2	1	11
Austria	6	3	1	2	10
North Macedonia	6	2	2	2	8
Israel	6	2	2	2	8
Latvia	6	0	0	6	0
Group H - A big week for France

Kingsley Coman (R) celebrates with Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud
Coming up: October 11 - Iceland v France, Turkey v Albania, Andorra v Moldova; October 14 - France v Turkey, Iceland v Andorra, Moldova v Albania

It's a pivotal week in Group H as France get set to face Iceland and Turkey. Two wins from two for Didier Deschamps' side, who currently sit second in the group behind Turkey on goal difference and three points ahead of third-placed Iceland, would see them take a huge stride towards qualification.

Albania, who are six points behind Turkey and France, will be hoping they can still sneak into the qualification spots with four games to go, but there's not much room for error for Edoardo Reja's side.

Group H
P	W	D	L	Pts
Turkey	6	5	0	1	15
France	6	5	0	1	15
Iceland	6	4	0	2	12
Albania	6	3	0	3	9
Moldova	6	1	0	5	3
Andorra	6	0	0	6	0
Group I - One last chance for Scotland
Coming up: October 10 - Kazakhstan v Cyprus, Belgium v San Marino, Russia v Scotland; October 13 - Kazakhstan v Belgium, Cyprus v Russia, Scotland v San Marino

Belgium have a perfect record in qualification so far and they can confirm their place in next summer's tournament with victory against San Marino or a draw between Kazakhstan and Cyprus.

It's also a final throw of the dice for Scotland in Group I. Steve Clarke's side must beat Russia to have any chance of qualifying, but if they don't they could still reach Euro 2020 as they are guaranteed a play-off place for winning their Nations League group.

Group I could be done and dusted on Thursday if Russia, who are eight points clear of Cyprus and Kazakhstan in third and fourth respectively, beat Scotland and Kazakhstan draw with Cyprus.

Group I
P	W	D	L	Pts
Belgium	6	6	0	0	18
Russia	6	5	0	1	15
Kazakhstan	6	2	1	3	7
Cyprus	6	2	1	3	7
Scotland	6	2	0	4	6
San Marino	6	0	0	6	0
Group J - Italy lead the way
Coming up: October 12 - Bosnia and Herzegovina v Finland, Italy v Greece, Liechtenstein v Armenia; October 13 - Liechtenstein v Italy, Greece v Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland v Armenia

There's still plenty to play for in Group J with Finland, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece all still vying to finish in the qualification places with Italy, who have won all six of their games so far.

Roberto Mancini's side will qualify with victory over Greece, who need all three points to stay in contention on Saturday.

Finland, who have 12 points from their six games so far, currently sit second in the group and are on course to make their debut at a major finals. However, they face two big games against Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are five points behind Finland, and Armenia, who are third in the group, three points behind the Finns.

Group J
P	W	D	L	Pts
Italy	6	6	0	0	18
Finland	6	4	0	2	12

Media still does not completely get what a footballing disaster the galactico era was. Years 2001-2003 were successful because the tremendous team that Del Bosque had been building since 2000 was only gradually being dismantled (remember in 2002 only Figo and Ronaldo were newly signed galacticos). And then what happened in 2003? Del Bosque was dismissed (he wasn't renewed), Beckham signed, who along with Zidane a year earlier, now had an unbalanced team that set many new records for losses and winless seasons. That is football by Fiorentino.

VAR IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
Flatulent 007

Oh dear. I swear to the heavens, football journalism these days, is poor. Between incessant articles about Man Utd and the players they are not really linked with, pishpoor transfer speculation, race-baiting, political tripe of all kinds - I mean we even have to pay women footballers who have been in the sport ten minutes, the same as men now... Didn't take them long to ruin football, along with all else they've infected!Now we've got the endless ramblings of too many pundits, fairweathers and plastics, moaning about 'VAR'. TURN IT IN! Talk football. The rest is carp! It's what some suit who hated football in school, decided we all want to read every day.Let's get it straight. VAR is long overdue. While the results can still be manipulated, we've taken a massive step to eradicating favouritism, bad reffing, big teams getting it all their own way due to shouting loudest etc. NO more fake goals, no more Henry handballs, no more Diego and his 'Hand of God', no more world cups ruined by shoddy goal line decisions and clear off-sides not being given. It's all gone. And still... people are going on as if football 'was better' when you couldn't hope for a fair result! We've got pundits who played the game, only changing their opinion every five minutes, because suits who produce the shows, force them too for hits.
OLE GUNNAR SOLSKJAER'S THREE KEY CHALLENGES AT MANCHESTER UNITED
Prince Anthony
13 Jul
Tough times for Manchester United but I must say Pogba has acted this whole dilemma professionally despite the fact he wants to leave when you compare Neymar and Griezman not returning back for pre-season but I don't see Juventus or Real Madrid paying £150,000,000 for Pogba so he's got to stay, be a good boy and respect his contract. Love him or hate him, he is still the main man at United and if Ole could motivate him once again the way he did last season then that would be good news because if Pogba is motivated and plays to his full potential, the whole team will be happy and play better and Utd have the ability to finish teams off..... Utd won't miss Lukaku at all! They have a fine, young, English striker in Rashford with blistering pace and an eye for goal so Utd attack looks promising regardless

As great a Footballer he is - that lad has the sickening ability to destroy the harmony - from top to bottom - at any Football Club he's at. He's toxic. Every club has it's difficult players, but Neymar is on a whole different stratosphere.It beggers belief that Barca want him back after the manner in which he left; but it's quite obvious that Messi is the one that's leading the charge to bring back - regardless of how it looks on Barca. The one thing that annoys me the most - is why haven't PSG been FFP investigated over the initial transfer from Barca?! PSG are a small fish in a big pond & have zero history. They were only formed in the mid-70's & they've no worldwide fanbase to generate the huge sums of expenditure on players. They can't even fill their stadium, either & the only shirts they sell is in Paris. So where's all the revenue coming from, I ask?It comes from the same place City's revenue comes from - their oil-rich Arab owners & them giving money to their Arab oil-rich mates to sponsor their shirts & everything else. They're not legitimate sponsorship deals. It's in a sense - money laundering!

"Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale is ""angry"" and ""fed up"" at the Spanish giants and wants to leave the club, according to BBC Radio 5 Live's Guillem Balague.

Bale had been set to join Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning on a three-year contract in the summer - earning a reported £1m a week - but Real cancelled the deal because they wanted a transfer fee.

In July, Real manager Zinedine Zidane said ""we hope he leaves soon"", a comment to which Bale's agent Jonathan Barnett replied: ""Zidane is a disgrace - he shows no respect for a player that has done so much for Real Madrid.""

Bale has won four Champions Leagues, one La Liga title, a Copa del Rey and three Uefa Super Cups and Club World Cups during his time at Real, scoring more than 100 goals.

After the collapse of his move to China, the 30-year-old Wales international pulled out of a pre-season game in Munich - understood to be because he was not in the right mental state to play.

He has returned to the Real team this season, scoring twice in seven matches as they have moved to the top of La Liga.

But he was left out of the squad for last week's Champions League game against Club Bruges, before returning to the starting line-up for the 4-2 win against Granada on Saturday.

Why did Real fall out of love with Bale?
Does Bale deserve more respect at the Bernabeu?
Hazard scores first goal since Real move
""Gareth Bale is fed up,"" said Balague. ""He can do this no longer. At a time when he began to stand out, knowing that as he plays matches his fitness would be sharpened, he suddenly had to watch the game against Bruges in the stands. Nobody knows why.

""He is angry, confused. When Zidane returned to the club, he decided he did not want Bale, without anyone having offered a clear reasoning.

""Bale was told that Zidane, with whom he has a professional relationship, had made an unequivocal decision and was preparing for his departure.

""His agent, Jonathan Barnett, set out to find him alternative options, but Bale preferred - ahead of any other possibility - to remain at the club.

""What the Welshman does not quite understand is why the doors were opened, and then they did not let him go. Madrid agreed not to charge a transfer fee to the Chinese side Jiangsu Suning, but ultimately they backed down because they believed that another Chinese team were willing to pay a large amount for James Rodriguez, a rumour that ended up being false.

""Bale has played well in recent weeks - partly because he is angry - in response to the distance and coldness with which the coach treats him, and he has finally rebelled at his situation.

""It is said that he likes golf more than football, and it is true that he does not live the profession with the intensity of others, either on or off the pitch.

""He only asks for minutes to be able to give his best and to be able to offer goals to the team, something they lack.

""Leaving him out of the game against Bruges is difficult to understand, and has been the last straw.

""For the first time since he arrived at Real Madrid in the summer of 2013, the Welshman wants to leave. He feels that it is not fair what is being done with him."""
"Football
SOCCER
Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing teamís goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.

Football is the worldís most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Footballís governing body, the FÈdÈration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people ìinterestedî in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched footballís premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.

History
The early years
Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, ìfolk footballî games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the gameís status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these ìCambridge rules,î which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.

The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubsí initial dominance had diminished.


Professionalism
The development of modern football was closely tied to processes of industrialization and urbanization in Victorian Britain. Most of the new working-class inhabitants of Britainis industrial towns and cities gradually lost their old bucolic pastimes, such as badger-baiting, and sought fresh forms of collective leisure. From the 1850s onward, industrial workers were increasingly likely to have Saturday afternoons off work, and so many turned to the new game of football to watch or to play. Key urban institutions such as churches, trade unions, and schools organized working-class boys and men into recreational football teams. Rising adult literacy spurred press coverage of organized sports, while transport systems such as the railways or urban trams enabled players and spectators to travel to football games. Average attendance in England rose from 4,600 in 1888 to 7,900 in 1895, rising to 13,200 in 1905 and reaching 23,100 at the outbreak of World War I. Footballís popularity eroded public interest in other sports, notably cricket.

Leading clubs, notably those in Lancashire, started charging admission to spectators as early as the 1870s and so, despite the FAís amateurism rule, were in a position to pay illicit wages to attract highly skilled working-class players, many of them hailing from Scotland. Working-class players and northern English clubs sought a professional system that would provide, in part, some financial reward to cover their ìbroken timeî (time lost from their other work) and the risk of injury. The FA remained staunchly elitist in sustaining a policy of amateurism that protected upper and upper-middle class influence over the game.

The issue of professionalism reached a crisis in England in 1884, when the FA expelled two clubs for using professional players. However, the payment of players had become so commonplace by then that the FA had little option but to sanction the practice a year later, despite initial attempts to restrict professionalism to reimbursements for broken time. The consequence was that northern clubs, with their large supporter bases and capacity to attract better players, came to prominence. As the influence of working-class players rose in football, the upper classes took refuge in other sports, notably cricket and rugby union. Professionalism also sparked further modernization of the game through the establishment of the Football League, which allowed the leading dozen teams from the North and Midlands to compete systematically against each other from 1888 onward. A lower, second division was introduced in 1893, and the total number of teams increased to 28. The Irish and Scots formed leagues in 1890. The Southern League began in 1894 but was absorbed by the Football League in 1920. Yet football did not become a major profit-making business during this period. Professional clubs became limited liability companies primarily to secure land for gradual development of stadium facilities. Most clubs in England were owned and controlled by businessmen but shareholders received very low, if any, dividends; their main reward was an enhanced public status through running the local club.


Later national leagues overseas followed the British model, which included league championships, at least one annual cup competition, and a hierarchy of leagues that sent clubs finishing highest in the tables (standings) up to the next higher division (promotion) and clubs at the bottom down to the next lower division (relegation). A league was formed in the Netherlands in 1889, but professionalism arrived only in 1954. Germany completed its first national championship season in 1903, but the Bundesliga, a comprehensive and fully professional national league, did not evolve until 60 years later. In France, where the game was introduced in the 1870s, a professional league did not begin until 1932, shortly after professionalism had been adopted in the South American countries of Argentina and Brazil.

International organization
By the early 20th century, football had spread across Europe, but it was in need of international organization. A solution was found in 1904, when representatives from the football associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland founded the FÈdÈration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).


Although Englishman Daniel Woolfall was elected FIFA president in 1906 and all of the home nations (England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales) were admitted as members by 1911, British football associations were disdainful of the new body. FIFA members accepted British control over the rules of football via the International Board, which had been established by the home nations in 1882. Nevertheless, in 1920 the British associations resigned their FIFA memberships after failing to persuade other members that Germany, Austria, and Hungary should be expelled following World War I. The British associations rejoined FIFA in 1924 but soon after insisted upon a very rigid definition of amateurism, notably for Olympic football. Other nations again failed to follow their lead, and the British resigned once more in 1928, remaining outside FIFA until 1946. When FIFA established the World Cup championship, British insouciance toward the international game continued. Without membership in FIFA, the British national teams were not invited to the first three competitions (1930, 1934, and 1938). For the next competition, held in 1950, FIFA ruled that the two best finishers in the British home nations tournament would qualify for World Cup play; England won, but Scotland (which finished second) chose not to compete for the World Cup.

Despite sometimes fractious international relations, football continued to rise in popularity. It made its official Olympic debut at the London Games in 1908, and it has since been played in each of the Summer Games (except for the 1932 Games in Los Angeles). FIFA also grew steadilyóespecially in the latter half of the 20th century, when it strengthened its standing as the gameís global authority and regulator of competition. Guinea became FIFAís 100th member in 1961; at the turn of the 21st century, more than 200 nations were registered FIFA members, which is more than the number of countries that belong to the United Nations.

The World Cup finals remain footballís premier tournament, but other important tournaments have emerged under FIFA guidance. Two different tournaments for young players began in 1977 and 1985, and these became, respectively, the World Youth Championship (for those 20 years old and younger) and the Under-17 World Championship. Futsal, the world indoor five-a-side championship, started in 1989. Two years later the first Womenís World Cup was played in China. In 1992 FIFA opened the Olympic football tournament to players aged under 23 years, and four years later the first womenís Olympic football tournament was held. The World Club Championship debuted in Brazil in 2000. The Under-19 Womenís World Championship was inaugurated in 2002.

FIFA membership is open to all national associations. They must accept FIFAís authority, observe the laws of football, and possess a suitable football infrastructure (i.e., facilities and internal organization). FIFA statutes require members to form continental confederations. The first of these, the ConfederaciÛn Sudamericana de F˙tbol (commonly known as CONMEBOL), was founded in South America in 1916. In 1954 the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) were established. Africaís governing body, the ConfÈdÈration Africaine de Football (CAF), was founded in 1957. The Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) followed four years later. The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) appeared in 1966. These confederations may organize their own club, international, and youth tournaments, elect representatives to FIFAís Executive Committee, and promote football in their specific continents as they see fit. In turn, all football players, agents, leagues, national associations, and confederations must recognize the authority of FIFAís Arbitration Tribunal for Football, which effectively functions as footballís supreme court in serious disputes.

Until the early 1970s, control of FIFA (and thus of world football) was firmly in the hands of northern Europeans. Under the presidencies of the Englishmen Arthur Drewry (1955ñ61) and Stanley Rous (1961ñ74), FIFA adopted a rather conservative patrician relationship to the national and continental bodies. It survived on modest income from the World Cup finals, and relatively little was done to promote football in developing countries or to explore the gameís business potential within the Westís postwar economic boom. FIFAís leadership was more concerned with matters of regulation, such as confirming amateur status for Olympic competition or banning those associated with illegal transfers of players with existing contracts. For example, Colombia (1951ñ54) and Australia (1960ñ63) were suspended temporarily from FIFA after permitting clubs to recruit players who had broken contracts elsewhere in the world.

Growing African and Asian membership within FIFA undermined European control. In 1974 Brazilian Jo„o Havelange was elected president, gaining large support from developing nations. Under Havelange, FIFA was transformed from an international gentlemenís club into a global corporation: billion-dollar television deals and partnerships with major transnational corporations were established during the 1980s and í90s. While some earnings were reinvested through FIFA development projectsóprimarily in Asia, Africa, and Central Americaóthe biggest political reward for developing countries has been the expansion of the World Cup finals to include more countries from outside Europe and South America.

Greater professionalization of sports also forced FIFA to intercede in new areas as a governing body and competition regulator. The use of performance-enhancing drugs by teams and individual players had been suspected since at least the 1930s; FIFA introduced drug tests in 1966, and occasionally drug users were uncovered, such as Willie Johnston of Scotland at the 1978 World Cup finals. But FIFA regulations were tightened in the 1980s after the sharp rise in offenses among Olympic athletes, the appearance of new drugs such as the steroid nandrolone, and the use of drugs by stars such as Argentinaís Diego Maradona in 1994. While FIFA has authorized lengthy worldwide bans of players who fail drug tests, discrepancies remain between nations and confederations over the intensity of testing and the legal status of specific drugs.

As the sport moved into the 21st century, FIFA came under pressure to respond to some of the major consequences of globalization for international football. During the corrupt tenure of Switzerlandís Sepp Blatter as president from 1998 to 2015, the political bargaining and wrangling among world footballís officials gained greater media and public attention. Direct conflicts of interest among footballís various groups have also arisen: players, agents, television networks, competition sponsors, clubs, national bodies, continental associations, and FIFA all have divergent views regarding the staging of football tournaments and the distribution of footballís income. Regulation of player representatives and transfers is also problematic. In UEFA countries, players move freely when not under contract. On other continents, notably Africa and Central and South America, players tend to be tied into long-term contracts with clubs that can control their entire careers. FIFA now requires all agents to be licensed and to pass written examinations held by national associations, but there is little global consistency regarding the control of agent powers. In Europe, agents have played a key role in promoting wage inflation and higher player mobility. In Latin America, players are often partially ìownedî by agents who may decide on whether transfers proceed. In parts of Africa, some European agents have been compared to slave traders in the way that they exercise authoritarian control over players and profit hugely from transfer fees to Western leagues with little thought for their clientsí well-being. In this way, the ever-widening inequalities between developed and developing nations are reflected in the uneven growth and variable regulations of world football.

Football Around The World
Regional traditions
Europe
England and Scotland had the first leagues, but clubs sprang up in most European nations in the 1890s and 1900s, enabling these nations to found their own leagues. Many Scottish professional players migrated south to join English clubs, introducing English players and audiences to more-advanced ball-playing skills and to the benefits of teamwork and passing. Up to World War II, the British continued to influence footballís development through regular club tours overseas and the Continental coaching careers of former players. Itinerant Scots were particularly prominent in central Europe. The interwar Danubian school of football emerged from the coaching legacies and expertise of John Madden in Prague and Jimmy Hogan in Austria.

Before World War II, Italian, Austrian, Swiss, and Hungarian teams emerged as particularly strong challengers to the British. During the 1930s, Italian clubs and the Italian national team recruited high-calibre players from South America (mainly Argentina and Uruguay), often claiming that these rimpatriati were essentially Italian in nationality; the great Argentinians Raimondo Orsi and Enrique Guaita were particularly useful acquisitions. But only after World War II was the preeminence of the home nations (notably England) unquestionably usurped by overseas teams. In 1950 England lost to the United States at the World Cup finals in Brazil. Most devastating were later, crushing losses to Hungary: 6ñ3 in 1953 at Londonís Wembley Stadium, then 7ñ1 in Budapest a year later. The ìMagical Magyarsî opened English eyes to the dynamic attacking and tactically advanced football played on the Continent and to the technical superiority of players such as Ferenc Pusk·s, JÛzsef Bozsik, and N·ndor Hidegkuti. During the 1950s and í60s, Italian and Spanish clubs were the most active in the recruitment of top foreign players. For example, the Welshman John Charles, known as ìthe Gentle Giant,î remains a hero for supporters of the Juventus club of Turin, Italy, while the later success of Real Madrid was built largely on the play of Argentinian Alfredo Di Stefano and the Hungarian Pusk·s.

European football has also reflected the wider political, economic, and cultural changes of modern times. Heightened nationalism and xenophobia have pervaded matches, often as a harbinger of future hostilities. During the 1930s, international matches in Europe were often seen as national tests of physical and military capability. In contrast, footballís early post-World War II boom witnessed massive, well-behaved crowds that coincided with Europeís shift from warfare to rebuilding projects and greater internationalism. More recently, racism became a more prominent feature of football, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s: many coaches projected negative stereotypes onto black players; supporters routinely abused nonwhites on and off the fields of play; and football authorities failed to counteract racist incidents at games. In general terms, racism at football reflected wider social problems across western Europe. In postcommunist eastern Europe, economic decline and rising nationalist sentiments have marked football culture too. The tensions that exploded in Yugoslaviaís civil war were foreshadowed during a match in May 1990 between the Serbian side Red Star Belgrade and the Croatian team Dynamo Zagreb when violence involving rival supporters and Serbian riot police spread to the pitch to include players and coaches.


Club football reflects the distinctive political and cultural complexities of European regions. In Britain, partisan football has been traditionally associated with the industrial working class, notably in cities such as Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, and Newcastle. In Spain, clubs such as FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao are symbols of strong nationalist identity for Catalans and Basques, respectively. In France, many clubs have facilities that are open to the local community and reflect the nationís corporatist politics in being jointly owned and administered by private investors and local governments. In Italy, clubs such as Fiorentina, Inter Milan, SSC Napoli, and AS Roma embody deep senses of civic and regional pride that predate Italian unification in the 19th century.

The dominant forces in European national football have been Germany, Italy, and, latterly, France; their national teams have won a total of seven World Cups and six European Championships. Success in club football has been built largely on recruitment of the worldís leading players, notably by Italian and Spanish sides. The European Cup competition for national league champions, first played in 1955, was initially dominated by Real Madrid; other regular winners have been AC Milan, Bayern Munich (Germany), Ajax of Amsterdam, and Liverpool FC (England). The UEFA Cup, first contested as the Fairs Cup in 1955ñ58, has had a wider pool of entrants and winners.

Since the late 1980s, topflight European football has generated increasing financial revenues from higher ticket prices, merchandise sales, sponsorship, advertising, and, in particular, television contracts. The top professionals and largest clubs have been the principal beneficiaries. UEFA has reinvented the European Cup as the Champions League, allowing the wealthiest clubs freer entry and more matches. In the early 1990s, Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman sued the Belgian Football Association, challenging European footballís traditional rule that all transfers of players (including those without contracts) necessitate an agreement between the clubs in question, usually involving a transfer fee. Bosman had been prevented from joining a new club (US Dunkerque) by his old club (RC LiËge). In 1995 the European courts upheld Bosmanís complaint, and at a stroke freed uncontracted European players to move between clubs without transfer fees. The bargaining power of players was strengthened greatly, enabling top stars to multiply their earnings with large salaries and signing bonuses. Warnings of the end of European footballís financial boom came when FIFAís marketing agent, ISL, went bust in 2001; such major media investors in football as the Kirch Gruppe in Germany and ITV Digital in the United Kingdom collapsed a year later. Inevitably, the financial boom had exacerbated inequalities within the game, widening the gap between the top players, the largest clubs, and the wealthiest spectators and their counterparts in lower leagues and the developing world.

North and Central America and the Caribbean
Football was brought to North America in the 1860s, and by the mid-1880s informal matches had been contested by Canadian and American teams. It soon faced competition from other sports, including variant forms of football. In Canada, Scottish ÈmigrÈs were particularly prominent in the gameís early development; however, Canadians subsequently turned to ice hockey as their national sport.

In the United States, gridiron football emerged early in the 20th century as the most popular sport. But, beyond elite universities and schools, soccer (as the sport is popularly called in the United States) was played widely in some cities with large immigrant populations such as Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland (Ohio), and St. Louis (Missouri), as well as New York City and Los Angeles after Hispanic migrations. The U.S. Soccer Federation formed in 1913, affiliated with FIFA, and sponsored competitions. Between the world wars, the United States attracted scores of European emigrants who played football for local teams sometimes sponsored by companies.

Football in Central America struggled to gain a significant foothold in competition against baseball. In Costa Rica, the football federation founded the national league championship in 1921, but subsequent development in the region was slower, with belated FIFA membership for countries such as El Salvador (1938), Nicaragua (1950), and Honduras (1951). In the Caribbean, football traditionally paled in popularity to cricket in former British colonies. In Jamaica, football was highly popular in urban townships, but it did not capture the imagination of the country until 1998, when the national teamófeaturing several players who had gained success in Britain and were dubbed the ìReggae Boyzîóqualified for the World Cup finals.

North American leagues and tournaments saw an infusion of professional players in 1967, beginning with the wholesale importation of foreign teams to represent American cities. The North American Soccer League (NASL) formed a year later and struggled until the New York Cosmos signed the Brazilian superstar PelÈ in 1975. Other aging international stars soon followed, and crowds grew to European proportions, but a regular fan base remained elusive, and NASL folded in 1985. An indoor football tournament, founded in 1978, evolved into a league and flourished for a while but collapsed in 1992.

In North America football did establish itself as the relatively less-violent alternative to gridiron football and as a more socially inclusive sport for women. It is particularly popular among college and high school students across the United States. After hosting an entertaining World Cup finals in 1994, the United States possessed some 16 million football players nationwide, up to 40 percent of whom were female. In 1996 a new attempt at establishing a professional outdoor league was made. Major League Soccer (MLS) was more modest in ambition than NASL, being originally played in only 10 U.S. cities, with greater emphasis on local players and a relatively tight salary cap. The MLS proved to be the most successful American soccer league, expanding to 20 teams (with two in Canada) by 2016 while also signing a number of lucrative broadcasting deals with American television networks and some star players from European leagues. The United States hosted and won the Womenís World Cup finals in 1999, attracting enthusiastic local support. The success of the MLS and the Womenís World Cup led to the creation of a womenís professional league in 2001. The Womenís United Soccer Association (WUSA) began with eight teams and featured the worldís star player, Mia Hamm, but it disbanded in 2003.

North American national associations are members of the continental body, CONCACAF, and Mexico is the traditional regional powerhouse. Mexico has won the CONCACAF Gold Cup four times since it was first contested in 1991, and Mexican clubs have dominated the CONCACAF Champions Cup for clubs since it began in 1962. British influence in mining and railroads encouraged the founding of football clubs in Mexico in the late 19th century. A national league was established in 1903. Mexico is exceptional in that its mass preference for football runs counter to the sporting tastes of its North American neighbours. The national league system is the most commercially successful in the region and attracts players from all over the Western Hemisphere. Despite high summer humidity and stadiums at high elevations, Mexico has hosted two of the most memorable World Cup finals, in 1970 and 1986, from which Brazil and Argentina (led by the gameís then greatest players, PelÈ and Maradona, respectively) emerged as the respective winners. While the national team has been ranked highly by FIFA, often figuring in the top ten, Mexico initially did not produce the world-class calibre of players expected of such a large football-crazed nation. Hugo Sanchez (at Real Madrid) was the only Mexican player to reach the highest world level in the 20th century, but the 21st saw a number of Mexican standouts excel with top European clubs.

South America
Football first came to South America in the 19th century through the port of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where European sailors played the game. Members of the British community there formed the first club, the Buenos Aires Football Club (FC), in 1867; about the same time, British railway workers started another club, in the town of Rosario, Argentina. The first Argentinian league championship was played in 1893, but most of the players belonged to the British community, a pattern that continued until the early 20th century.

Brazil is believed to be the second South American country where the game was established. Charles Miller, a leading player in England, came to Brazil in 1894 and introduced football in S„o Paulo; that cityís athletic club was the first to take up the sport. In Colombia, British engineers and workers building a railroad near Barranquilla first played football in 1903, and the Barranquilla FBC was founded in 1909. In Uruguay, British railway workers were the first to play, and in 1891 they founded the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (now the famous PeÒarol), which played both cricket and football. In Chile, British sailors initiated play in Valparaiso, establishing the Valparaiso FC in 1889. In Paraguay, Dutchman William Paats introduced the game at a school where he taught physical education, but the countryís first (and still leading) club, Olimpia, was formed by a local man who became enthusiastic after seeing the game in Buenos Aires in 1902. In Bolivia the first footballers were a Chilean and students who had studied in Europe, and in Peru they were expatriate Britons. In Venezuela, British miners are known to have played football in the 1880s.

Soon local people across South America began taking up and following the sport in ever greater numbers. Boys, mostly from poorer backgrounds, played from an early age, with passion, on vacant land and streets. Clubs and players gained popularity, and professionalism entered the sport in most countries around the 1930sóalthough many players had been paid secretly before then by their clubs. The exodus of South American players to European clubs that paid higher salaries began after the 1930 World Cup and has steadily increased.


By the late 1930s, football had become a crucial aspect of popular culture in many South American nations; ethnic and national identities were constructed and played out on an increasingly international stage. In South American nations, nonwhite players fought a successful struggle to play at the top level: in Rio de Janeiro, Vasco da Gama was the first club to recruit black players and promptly stormed to the league championship in 1923, encouraging other clubs to follow suit. In Uruguay, a nation of largely mixed European descent, local players learned both the physical style played by the English and the more refined passing game of the Scots, producing a versatility that helped their national team win two Olympic championships and the World Cup between 1924 and 1930.

In 1916, South American countries were the first to hold a regular continental championshipólater known as the Copa AmÈrica. In 1960 the South American club championship (Libertadores Cup) was started; it has been played annually by the continentís leading clubs (with the winner playing the European club champion), and, as a result of its popularity, various other international competitions have also been held between clubs. Domestic league championships are split into two or more tournaments each season with frequent variations in format.

Africa
European sailors, soldiers, traders, engineers, and missionaries brought football with them to Africa in the second half of the 19th century. The first documented match took place in Cape Town in 1862, after which the game spread rapidly throughout the continent, particularly in the British colonies and in societies with vibrant indigenous athletic traditions.

During the interwar period, African men in cities and towns, railroad workers, and students organized clubs, associations, and regional competitions. Teams from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia competed in the North African championship, established in 1919, and vied for the North African Cup, introduced in 1930. South of the Sahara, Kenya and Uganda first played for the Gossage Trophy in 1924, and the Darugar Cup was established on the island of Zanzibar. In the mining centre of …lisabethville (now Lubumbashi, Congo) a football league for Africans was begun in 1925. In South Africa the game was very popular by the early 1930s, though it was organized in racially segregated national associations for whites, Africans, Coloureds (persons of mixed race), and Indians. In the colonies of British West Africa, the Gold Coast (now Ghana) launched its first football association in 1922, with Nigeriaís southern capital of Lagos following suit in 1931. Enterprising clubs and leagues developed across French West Africa in the 1930s, especially in Senegal and CÙte díIvoire. Moroccan forward Larbi Ben Barek became the first African professional in Europe, playing for Olympique de Marseille and the French national team in 1938.

After World War II football in Africa experienced dramatic expansion. Modernizing colonial regimes provided new facilities and created attractive competitions, such as the French West Africa Cup in 1947. The migration of talented Africans to European clubs intensified. Together with his older compatriot Mario ColuÒa, Mozambican sensation EusÈbio, European player of the year in 1965, starred for European champions Benfica of Lisbon and led Portugal to third place in the 1966 World Cup, where he was the tournamentís leading scorer. Algerian stars Rachid Mekhloufi of Saint-…tienne and Mustafa Zitouni of AS Monaco represented France before joining the team of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1958. The FLN eleven, who lost only 4 of 58 matches during the period 1958ñ62, embodied the close relations between nationalist movements and football in Africa on the eve of decolonization.

With colonialismís hold on Africa slipping away, the ConfÈdÈration Africaine de Football (CAF) was established in February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, with the first African Cup of Nations tournament also played at that time. Independent African states encouraged football as a means of forging a national identity and generating international recognition.

In the 1960s and early í70s, African football earned a reputation for a spectacular, attacking style of play. African and European coaches emphasized craft, creativity, and fitness within solid but flexible tactical schemes. Salif Keita (Mali), Laurent Pokou (CÙte díIvoire), and FranÁois MíPelÈ (Congo [Brazzaville]) personified the dynamic qualities of football in postcolonial Africa.

In the late 1970s, the migration of talented players overseas began hampering domestic leagues. The effects of this player exodus were somewhat tempered by the rise of ìscientific footballî and defensive, risk-averting tactics, an international trend that saw African players fall out of favour with European clubs. Even so, the integration of Africa and Africans into world football accelerated in the 1980s and í90s. Cameroonís national team, known as the Indomitable Lions, was a driving force in this process. After being eliminated without losing a match at the 1982 World Cup in Spain (tied with Italy in its group, Cameroon lost the tiebreaker on the basis of total goals scored), Cameroon reached the quarterfinals at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, thereby catapulting African football into the global spotlight. Nigeria then captured the Olympic gold medal in menís football at the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996; in 2000 Cameroon won its first Olympic gold medal in menís football at the Games in Sydney, Australia. Success also came at youth level as Nigeria (1985) and Ghana (1991 and 1995) claimed under-17 world titles. Moreover, Liberian striker George Weah of Paris St. Germain received the prestigious FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1995.

In recognition of African footballís success and influence, FIFA awarded Africa five places in the 32-team 1998 World Cup finals. This achievement bears witness to African footballís phenomenal passion, growth, and development. This rich and complex history is made more remarkable by the continentís struggles to cope with a fragile environment, scarce material resources, political conflicts, and the unpleasant legacy of imperialism.

Asia and Oceania
Football quickly entered Asia and Oceania in the latter half of the 19th century, but, unlike in Europe, it failed to become a unifying national sport. In Australia it could not dislodge the winter games of Australian rules football (codified before soccer) and rugby. British immigrants to Australia did relatively little to develop football locally. Because southern European immigrants were more committed to founding clubs and tournaments, football became defined as an ìethnic game.î As a result, teams from Melbourne and Sydney with distinctive Mediterranean connections were the most prominent members of the National Soccer League (NSL) when it started in 1977. The league has widened its scope, however, to include a highly successful Perth side, plus a Brisbane club and even one from Auckland, New Zealand. The NSL collapsed in 2004, but a new league, known as the A-League, emerged the next year.

In New Zealand, Scottish players established clubs and tournaments from the 1880s, but rugby became the national passion. In Asia, during the same germinal period, British traders, engineers, and teachers set up football clubs in such colonial outposts as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Burma (Myanmar). Yet footballís major problem across Asia, until the 1980s, was its failure to establish substantial roots among indigenous peoples beyond college students returning from Europe. Football in India was particularly prominent in Calcutta (Kolkata) among British soldiers, but locals soon adopted cricket. In Japan, Yokohama and Kobe housed large numbers of football-playing foreigners, but local people retained preferences for the traditional sport of sumo wrestling and the imported game of baseball.

At the turn of the 21st century, football became increasingly important in Asian societies. In Iran, national team football matches became opportunities for many to express their reformist political views as well as for broad public celebration. The Iraqi menís teamís fourth-place finish at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens struck a chord of hope for their war-torn homeland.

The Asian game is organized by the Asian Football Confederation, comprising 46 members in 2011 and stretching geographically from Lebanon in the Middle East to Guam in the western Pacific Ocean. The Asian Cup for national teams has been held quadrennially since 1956; Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Japan have dominated, with South Korea a regular runner-up. These countries have also produced the most frequent winners of the annual Asian Club Championship, first contested in 1967.

Asian economic growth during the 1980s and early 1990s and greater cultural ties to the West helped cultivate club football. Japanís J-League was launched in 1993, attracting strong public interest and a sprinkling of famous foreign players and coaches (notably from South America). Attendance and revenue declined from 1995, but the league survived and was reorganized into two divisions of 16 and 10 clubs, respectively, by 1999. The league grew to 30 teams by 2005 but had reduced to 18 by 2018.

Some memorable international moments have indicated the potential of football in Asia and Oceania. Asiaís first notable success was North Koreaís stunning defeat of Italy at the 1966 World Cup finals. In 1994 Saudi Arabia became the first Asian team to qualify for the World Cupís second round. The entertaining 2002 World Cup hosted by Japan and South Korea and the on-field success of the host nationsí national teams (South Korea reached the semifinals; Japan reached the second round) stood as the regionís brightest accomplishment in international football.

Footballís future in Asia and Oceania depends largely upon regular competition with top international teams and players. Increased representation in the World Cup finals (since 1998 Asia has sent four teams, and since 2006 Oceania has had a single automatic berth) has helped development of the sport in the region. Meanwhile, domestic club competitions across Asia and Oceania have been weakened by the need for top national players to join better clubs in Europe or South America to test and improve their talents at a markedly higher level. One promising development for the continent came in 2010 when Qatar was announced as the host of the 2022 World Cup, which will be the first World Cup held in the Middle East.

Spectator problems
The spread of football throughout the globe has brought together people from diverse cultures in celebration of a shared passion for the game, but it has also spawned a worldwide epidemic of spectator hooliganism. High emotions that sometimes escalate into violence, both on and off the field, have always been a part of the game, but concern with fan violence and hooliganism has intensified since the 1960s. The early focus of this concern was British fans, but the development of the anti-hooligan architecture of football grounds around the world points to the international scope of the problem. Stadiums in Latin America are constructed with moats and high fences. Many grounds in Europe now ban alcohol and no longer offer sections where fans can stand; those ìterraces,î which charged lower admission than ticketed seating, were the traditional flash points of fan violence.

BRITANNICA QUIZ
Football (Soccer): Fact or Fiction?
If a player commits a major foul in football (soccer), the opposing team is awarded a corner kick.
Some of the first modern hooligan groups were found in Scotland, where religious sectarianism arose among the supporters of two Glasgow teams: Rangers, whose fans were predominantly Protestant unionists, and Celtic, whose fans were drawn largely from the cityís sizeable Irish Catholic community. Between the World Wars, ìrazor gangsî fought street battles when these two clubs met. Since the late 1960s, however, English fan hooliganism has been even more notorious, especially when English supporters have followed their teams overseas. The nadir of fan violence came during the mid-1980s. At the European Cup final in 1985 between Liverpool and the Italian club Juventus at Heysel Stadium in Brussels, 39 fans (38 Italian, 1 Belgian) died and more than 400 were injured when, as Liverpool supporters charged opposing fans, a stadium wall collapsed under the pressure of those fleeing. In response, English clubs were banned from European competition until 1990, but by then hooliganism had become established in many other European countries. By the turn of the 21st century, self-identifying hooligans could be found among German, Dutch, Belgian, and Scottish supporters. Elsewhere, militant fans included the ultras in Italy and southern France, and the various hinchadas of Spain and Latin America, whose levels of violence varied from club to club. Argentina has experienced perhaps the worst consequences, with an estimated 148 deaths between 1939 and 2003 from violent incidents that often involved security forces.

The causes of football hooliganism are numerous and vary according to the political and cultural context. High levels of alcohol consumption can exaggerate supporter feelings and influence aggression, but this is neither the single nor the most important cause of hooliganism, given that many heavily intoxicated fans instead behave gregariously. In northern Europe fan violence has acquired an increasingly subcultural dimension. At major tournaments, self-identifying hooligans sometimes can spend weeks pursuing their distinctive peers among opposing supporters to engage in violence; the most successful combatants earn status within the subcultural network of hooligan groups. Research in Britain suggests these groups do not hail from societyís poorest members but usually from more-affluent working-class and lower middle-class backgrounds, depending upon regional characteristics. In southern Europe, notably in Italy, spectator violence can also reflect deep-seated cultural rivalries and tensions, especially between neighbouring cities or across the divide between north and south. In Latin America fan violence has been understood in relation to the modern politics of dictatorship and repressive state methods of social control. Moreover, the upsurge in violence in Argentina beginning in the late 1990s has been explained according to the severe decline of the national economy and the political system.


In some circumstances, football hooliganism has forced politicians and the judiciary to intercede directly. In England the Conservative government of the 1980s targeted football hooligans with legislation, and the subsequent Labour administration unveiled further measures to control spectator behaviour inside stadiums. In Argentina, football matches were briefly suspended by the courts in 1999 in a bid to halt the violence. Football authorities have also recognized fan violence as a major impediment to the gameís economic and social health. In England attempts at reducing hooliganism have included all-seated stadiums and the creation of family-only stands. These measures have helped attract new, wealthier spectators, but critics have argued that the new policies have also diminished the colour and atmosphere at football grounds. More liberal anti-hooligan strategies encourage dialogue with supporters: the ìfan projectsî run by clubs and local authorities in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden are the strongest illustrations of this approach.

Still, the major threats to spectator safety tend to involve not fighting among supporters but rather a mixture of factors such as disorderly crowd responses to play in the match, unsafe facilities, and poor crowd-control techniques. In the developing world, crowd stampedes have caused many disasters, such as the 126 deaths in Ghana in 2001. Police attempts to quell disorderly crowds can backfire and exacerbate the dangers, as was the case in Peru in 1964 when 318 died and in Zimbabwe in 2000 when 13 died. Disastrous crowd management strategies and facilities that some have characterized as inhumane were at the root of the tragedy in Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, in 1989, in which 96 were fatally injured when they were crushed inside the football ground.


It would be quite wrong, however, to portray the vast majority of football fans as inherently violent or xenophobic. Since the 1980s, organized supporter groups, along with football authorities and players, have waged both local and international campaigns against racism and (to a lesser extent) sexism within the game. Football supporters with the most positive, gregarious reputationsósuch as those following the Danish, Irish, and Brazilian national sidesótend to engage in self-policing within their own ranks, with few calls for outside assistance. As part of their Fair Play campaigns, international football bodies have introduced awards for the best-behaved supporters at major tournaments. In more challenging circumstances, English fan organizations such as the Football Supportersí Federation have sought to improve the behaviour of their compatriots at matches overseas by planning meetings with local police officials and introducing ìfan embassiesî for visiting supporters. Across Europe, international fan networks have grown up to combat the racism that has also been reflected in some hooliganism. More generally, since the mid-1980s, the production of fanzines (fan magazines) across Britain and some other parts of Europe have served to promote the view that football fans are passionate, critical, humorous, and (for the great majority) not at all violent. Such fanzines have been supplemented byóand in many ways surpassed byóInternet fan sites in the 21st century.

To begin with, Finlandís banking sector is considered to be one of the safest in the world due to the fact that there are mostly savings and co-operative banks. In addition to that, new banking technologies are constantly implemented in Finlandís banking sector. Hence, itís no surprise that opening an account or making various transactions in Finland is relatively easy. Finlandís central bank governor has led the way (by example) on splitting investment banking and deposit-taking activities in the European Union. Additionally, Finlandís banks rank on the top of all lists that feature the safest banks in the world.

Canada
Bay street

Canadaís banking system is a textbook example of stability. The country has managed to have zero banking failures even during the period of the Great Depression. In fact, the only two Canadian banks that bankrupted in the last 100 years were Canadian Commercial and Northland Bank. This says a lot about the safety of keeping your money in a Canadian bank.

When talking about the countries with the safest banks we canít forget to mention Hong Kong. Being the financial center that it is, itís no surprise that this country has some of the safest banks on the planet. Evenmore, all global banks have their branches in Hong Kong; so, there is a variety of options to choose from.

Norway

Even though Norway has faced a few issues with its banking system recently, its banks still remain to be one of the safest in the world.

Singapore is one of the worldís most important financial centers and home to some of the safest banks in the world. Singaporeís banks have been declared as the safest ones in Asia year after year despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in recent years.

Germany

On the Global Financeís list of the top 10 banks, four are from Germany. One of the reasons why German banks are so trusted is probably the countryís strong economy. Additionally, Germany takes its banking very seriously and is paying special attention to capital controls. However, there are certain disadvantages to opening a bank account in Germany as a foreigner. One of the main ones is the low interest rates that foreign accounts generally get on their savings accounts.

Switzerland
swiss bank




We canít really talk about bank secrecy without at least mentioning Switzerland. Ever since the implementation of the countryís famous bank secrecy in 1934, Switzerland has been the most popular destination for offshore banking in the world. Banks in Switzerland are required by law to have high capital requirements and strong depository protection in order to protect themselves in case of a financial crisis.

Luxembourg
luxembourg bank

Attracting thousands of investors every year, Luxembourg is one of Europeís main offshore hubs. In addition to opening bank accounts, foreigners can also get V-Pat credit cards, depending on their income levels and sources. Luxembourg is also home to Banque et Caisse dí…pargne de lí…tat; a bank thatís often cited as one of the safest banks in the world.

Sweden

Similarly like Norway and other Scandinavian countries, Sweden has a very safe banking system. Swedenís banks are stable and independent and the countryís currency remains strong despite the ongoing financial crisis in Europe. Additionally, Sweden has relatively good interest rates compared to other offshore countries and banking staff are not allowed to disclose any information on accounts owned by foreigners unless theyíre compelled by the law.

Guatemala

When talking about the countries with the safest banks, Guatemala might not come to mind. However, we canít forget to mention Guatemala when talking about the worldís up and coming offshore destinations. Three banks from this country; Banco Industrial, Banco de Desarrollo Rural, and Banco G&T International are ranked among the safest banks in the world according to the World Economic Forum.

Chile

According to Global Finance, Chilean banks dominate the list of safest banks in Latin America. This comes as no surprise as Chile is the fastest growing economy in the region for the last few decades.

Panama

It might come as a surprise because Panama doesnít even have a Central bank but that isnít an obstacle for the banks in Panama to be some of the safest in the world. Panamanian banks are conservative and most of them have capital ratios that are twice the size of the required minimum! Also, Panama is traditionally famous for being a tax haven for many American businessman.

South Africa

Year after year, South African banks dominate the lists of the safest banks in Africa. Additionally, South Africaís so-called ëBig Four Banksí (Standard Bank, First Rand Bank, Nedbank, Barclays Africa) are widely seen as some of the safest ones in the world.

Belize

Previously known as British Honduras, Belize is a tiny country in the Caribbean and one of the most famous tax haven destinations in the world. Belizeís government made a plan in the 1990sí to improve the countryís economy through its financial industry. In the last 30 years, not only did they achieve this but today, Belize is the favorite offshore destination among businessmen from around the world.

Vanuatu

"Travel is not an exact science ñ it can be full of surprises, and mistakes are almost inevitable. With so many decisions, and so much organizing, youíre bound to fall short somewhere, but yours wonít be the only boo-boo youíll encounter. You probably have no idea the airline will add a hefty surcharge if you pay with a credit card, or youíll be up for $50 to board a budget airline with carry-on luggage weighing more than the limit. You could be faced with car hire excess fees and other surprises when operators ask for their well-hidden charges and you have no choice but to pay up. However, if youíre prepared for these travel rip-offs, you are at least forearmed, so here are some of the most common pitfalls and how to avoid falling foul of dodgy behavior.

Before we delve into the mistakes and travel rip-offs from airlines and other operators, there are things you have to do to lessen the chances of errors occurring while youíre overseas. Though it is obvious to seasoned travelers, one of the first things you must do, even if you have the best online savings account, is to notify your bank that you will be making transactions overseas. Can you imagine having your first delicious breakfast in another country, you go to pay the bill, but the bank sees the transaction as ëunusual activityí and puts a stop on the account? Major stuff-up. Before you leave, buy a travel card or travelerís cheques.  

Other tips:
Make sure youíve had your vaccinations and have travel insurance;
Donít overstuff your luggage or your itinerary;
Take account of time zones and jet lag;
Stick to your budget;
Get the proper visas;
Do your research so you can be culturally sensitive;
Travel with people you get along with;
Back up your photographs.
With that being said, letís see which are some of the most common ways people experience travel rip-offs on vacations.

The vanishing tour operator

Thereís nothing worse than booking your accommodation or sightseeing online, getting on a flight, and learning that this company doesnít exist after arriving. Even though a very basic thing, this can happen to anyone. There are thousands of websites on the internet and unfortunately, some of them are created with one goal; to scam people. Thatís why you should always do all of your bookings with reputable, ATOL-protected companies. This way, you will be protected even if the company youíre booking with actually stops existing for legitimate reasons. Even when booking with less-famous companies/websites, at least check the reviews to make sure everything is alright.

Extra charges on your debit card
international credit card


Report this ad

Using your credit card abroad always costs more than using your debit card in your home country. Almost all credit cards charge a non-sterling transaction fee (between 2.75% and 2.99%) that the card company/bank charges every time you use your card abroad. This means that youíll be paying between $102.75 and $102.99 for a $100-dollar transaction. Additionally, some cards also charge a non-sterling purchase fee, in addition to the transaction fee. And it doesnít end here!

Automatic Teller Machine Withdrawal Fees
Thailand ATM

Using your usual card at an overseas ATM usually results in your bank hitting you with a $5 fee on top of whatever the local operator will nab for the service and a currency conversion fee. Another option is actually travelerís cheques rather than travel money cards because with the latter you donít have to have ID. Yes, cards are more convenient, but If your cheques are lost or stolen, they can be replaced in 24 hours. Cards can take much longer. Travelerís cheques can be converted into many different currencies, with no transaction fees, which are paid when you buy the cheques. On the whole, travelerís cheques are a cheaper option but providing you are careful with your travel card, or you get one with no conversion fee, and youíre aware of the limitations of cheques, you will make the right decision.

Domestic and International Flights Excess Baggage Fees

Report this ad

Generally, passengers can take one bag and one personal item with them onto the plane, but there are weight restrictions. You can usually take a briefcase or laptop bag, and a handbag providing it fits beneath the cabin seat and one that fits in the overhead locker. Carry-on weights vary between airlines and classes but usually in economy class you can carry five to seven kilos while business and first-class can carry more. Always check with your airline and remember, luggage allowances might be different from domestic flights to international, and you could be caught out by a sneaky operator who includes your carry-on luggage with the rest and charges you an excess baggage fee, so keep an eye out for that. Itís more likely if you opt for a cheaper airline. 

Expensive taxi fares
taxi travel rip offs


Whether youíre taking a taxi from the airport or around the city, you can never be too careful. There are a lot of drivers out there that make a living from scamming tourists. Some might try to circle around in order to get more money from you, while others will flat out try to rip you off, counting on your lack of knowledge about the local streets and prices. You should never let this happen. Always be informed about the local living standard, have a rough idea of how much something might cost, try to see whatís the shortest route of getting somewhere, and always know if there are any taxi apps like Uber that you can use. This will always reduce the chance of you being scammed by a cunning local taxi driver.

Paying more than you should for visas
visa passport


There are a lot of websites on the internet that claim that they can arrange a visa for a certain country faster than anyone else. Some of these websites ask buyers to pay a sum of money that exceeds the actual visa fee by double or even triple and arranging your visa through such websites might cost you up to $100 more! In most cases, one can easily recognize whether a website is (not) legitimate just by taking a look at it. However, to be sure, always apply through an official government website.

Currency Conversion Traps
currency scam in Europe

Youíre in a shop buying the latest duty-free fashion jeans or some fabulous gadget, and the salesperson flashes a big smile and asks if youíd like to pay in dollars. Donít fall for it. If you pay in dollars, youíll fall foul of a dodgy exchange rate charge called a Dynamic Currency Conversion fee which could cost you five percent more than youíd pay in the local currency. Another tip, while overseas, donít buy foreign currency at the airport youíre departing from, or your pocket will suffer (most of the time). Youíre better off buying it at your destination where you will get a better rate. Or, get whatever foreign cash you need from an ATM using a travel card with no currency conversion fees. The interbank rate is the true rate of exchange, and you can check this on the Oanda website.

While youíre abroad
trekking nepal


There are some things you need to be aware of even after arriving at your destination. For example, a lot of tourists are surprised when charged a tourist tax and even more end up being surprised when their hotels asks them to pay a safe deposit box upon check-in, and the biggest travel rip-offs of all are related to additional charges for car rentals, so be careful with this. The best piece of advice I can give you before traveling isÖ

Be aware when you are most vulnerable
You are most vulnerable when youíre still trying to adjust to a new environment. Thatís why a lot of people get scammed by taxi drivers at airports. Similarly, a lot of people end up overpaying for things when using a new currency for the first time. When abroad, you have to train your brain to remember that youíre in a different environment and switching to a different ìgearî of thinking can be very helpful. When someone quotes a price, give yourself some time to think whether thatís a reasonable price or not. If youíre traveling with a companion, consult with them before making a purchase and donít make rash decisions.

"Despite the advancement of technology and boom of online casinos that have made it easy for people to play their favorite casino games on their smartphones and computers, this has not stopped casino lovers from traveling to different places to gamble. Many travelers cross countries and oceans to set their feet in some of the contemporary classic places with large casino complexes that are, frankly speaking, a lot more than that. Casinos arenít dark, mysterious places anymore. They are luxurious resorts that provide countless entertainment options. Perhaps this is the main reason why online casinos havenít completely wiped out traditional casinos. In fact, a lot of countries today are trying hard to develop emerging alternative casino cities to attract more tourists. However, there are several popular gambling destinations that attract thousands of gamblers from around the world every day. This article is about them!

With more than 30 luxurious casino resorts, Macauís casino tourism industry is a multi-billion dollar business. According to Forbes, the city in the South China Sea receives millions of gambling tourists from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and other places around the world every year. According to statistics, about 15% of locals participate in gambling. Forbes also ranks six casinos from Macau among the 20 largest in the world.

Macau is known for its eclectic skyscrapers that house some of the best casinos in the world. Grand Macau and Casino Lisboa are among the most popular casinos in the city. You can visit ìthe Las Vegas of Asiaî even when you are not a high roller. China is home to some of the most renowned casinos for betting all over the world, and thereís no better place to visit that the gambling capital itself, Macau.




USA
casino las vegas

This list couldnít be complete without the USA and the gambling capital of the world, Las Vegas. The city has been featured countless times in a lot of famous songs, films, books, and TV shows. The experience of visiting this Sin City in the middle of the desert cannot be matched by most other casino tourism destinations.




If youíre planning to visit Vegas soon, check out the Best of Vegas and get up to 40% on all shows, attractions, and tours in the city.

Las Vegas is known for roulette, dice, and other casino games. You are likely to come across slot machines in hotels, gas stations, and even grocery stores! However, this isnít the only gambling hub in the US. You will also find some decent alternatives to Vegas around the country. Some of them include Atlantic City, Reno, Fort Lauderdale, and even big cities like New Orleans and Philadelphia.

Singapore





The city-state of Singapore is one of Asiaís fastest rising casino destinations. With so many entertainment complexes, visitors in this city can engage in countless activities. Although Singapore may have a fewer number of casinos than Las Vegas, Macau, and other destinations, the Lion city receives millions of tourists from different parts of the world.

Gambling was illegal in Singapore until 2005 and still is today for locals (but not for foreigners). Since legalizing gambling in the mid-2000s, various casinos have opened in the country, including two of the worldís biggest casino resorts; Aegean Paradise Cruise and Marina Bay Sands, making Singapore one of the best gambling destinations in Asia. Additionally, Singapore has a lot more to offer than just gambling and one can never run out of things to do in Singapore.




United Kingdom
London




If you want to visit first-class casinos, London should definitely cross your mind. London is not just Europeís financial hub, itís a popular casino tourism destination that welcomes millions of casino lovers every year. Tourists in this city can also indulge in other activities, such as visiting the Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, attend sports and royal events, etc.

Unlike most of the other casino centers in the world, there are only a few hotels and casino resorts in London. However, new casinos have emerged (and still are) since the country deregulated the industry in the mid-2000s not only in London but in other cities too. A few other casino cities in the UK worth mentioning are Glasgow, Bournemouth, Stoke, Cardiff, etc.

Monaco

Monaco is said to be the oldest gambling resort in the world, with Monte Carlo offering casino games since 1863. Hence, itís no surprise that today, Monaco is home to some of the worldís best casinos.

However, unlike most of the gambling destinations, Monte Carlo is a playground for rich and famous people. Therefore, if youíre not invited or are not a wealthy person, you may not be allowed in some casinos but even if you donít plan on gambling you can check out a museum themed according to a 19th-century casino that regularly hosts events such as the Poker Stars Championships that attracts celebrities from around the world.

Cambodia
sihanoukville




Sihanoukville in Cambodia is the epicenter of Chinaís investment in Cambodia. This was once a small, charming coastal town thatís slowly turning into one of Southeast Asiaís main casino tourism hubs. Today, this city welcomes more than 1.5 million visitors, many of whom come here to gamble. Many locals are rightfully concerned that this might turn the once peaceful town into a playground for rich Chinese investors and take a toll on the authenticity of the place.

However, there are a lot of new casino complexes getting opened around the country as well. Cambodia has more than 150 casinos today, which is an increase of 53% compared to 2017; a pace of development that can easily compare to some of the much more famous destinations on this list.




The Bahamas
Paradise Island, Bahamas




Unlike most of the destinations on this list, the Bahamas combine luxurious casino complexes with a fair share of sunshine and beautiful white-sand beaches. The Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island is arguably the most renowned casino complex in the Caribbean. It hosts its own annual PokerStars Caribbean tournament, itís home to some impressive glass sculptures, and it even has its own seven-acre lagoonÖ"
"La Plagne Centre might sound like the, well, centre but La Plagne is a starburst of self-sufficient conurbations.

Centre might be the original, long, low 60s buildings (which, with their indoor shopping mall, have undergone a neat refurb) and Aime 2000 on the hill above it, mountain peak-shaped apartment blocks, is the wildest but theyíre not strictly at the centre. For that, and for charm, you canít beat Belle Plagne.



Pistes snake between the chalet-like apartments and hotels while at its heart is a Disney-like stone and timber traffic-free village with cosy bars and cafes wedged up against a boulangerie and stores stacked with local cheese and sausages.

And easy access to La Plagneís 225km of runs, the wide open expanses of piste in one direction, the lofty Bellecote glacier, the low, pretty village of Montchavin and Les Arcs in the other.

About La Plagne
Big enough in itself, La Plagne is also part of the worldís second biggest ski area, Paradiski, which takes in Les Arcs, reached via the Vanoise Express, a two-deck cable car that looks like a sci-fi London bus as it swishes across the valley (look through the glass floor panel for a hair-raising perspective).

Together there are 425km of runs plus a wealth of truly good off-piste. La Plagne tops out at 3,250m, Les Arcs not far off, so snow is very reliable. Itís one of those places where lifts form a spiderís web, even criss-crossing, so thereís no shortage of transport ñ and with most chairlifts carrying six or eight people any queues disappear quickly.

Youíve got easy cruising pistes with spectacular panoramas, youíve got neat villages deep into the forests and youíve got glaciers in both resorts. A free bus links a number of the centres well into the evening and the gondola between Belle Plagne and Bellecote runs as public transport until late.

The skiing at La Plagne
Phenomenal. Itís not for nothing that La Plagne rates itself the worldís most popular ski resort, with 2.5 million visitors each winter.

Belle Plagne
Belle Plagne
The skiing goes on and on and the signposts are important. From Belle Plagne one can jump on the gondola straight up to 2,739m Roche de Mio with runs amidst the craggiest peaks (and lifts to the glacier) or ski down to Bellecote where in one direction the Arpette chair accesses the long, winding runs down to Montchavin or the Les Arcs link while in the other is either the Blanchette or Colosses chair towards Plagne Centre, Plagne Villages, Plagne Soleil and Plagne 1800.

In this direction as with elsewhere, thereís always a blue run for the least confident skier along with reds, off-piste that wonít scare the pants off you and a black or two.

While the Bellcotte glacier has some decent pistes itís the gnarly black semi-pisted Rochu and Bellecote blacks that carve their way around the outside that are glorious for experts, steep and full of bumps with a wilderness feel, connecting with the long black Derochoir which funnels you back to civilisation.

If you like runs down amongst the trees, thereís plenty of that, at Montchavin at one end of La Plagne, at Montalbert at the other, and at little Champagny, hidden over the ridge from the Roche de Mio.

Yet for all the places to investigate, for many the big, open pistes that pour down amid the string of ridges that make up the vast area are what makes it special. Freewheeling skiing seemingly without end and in all directions and with wondrous views.

And then you swish down to the Vanoise Express for a second huge, world-famous resort ñ get there early and you basically have a dayís excursion, a world of cruising, the Aiguille Rouge glacier (with a selection of steep, daunting ëNaturí unpisted runs) and purpose-built villages dotted across the mountain.
Why go to La Plagne
The scope: Thereís so much skiing and so much of it is good. Whether youíre looking for tree-lined runs down to villages or panoramic above-treeline pistes, wide-open glaciers or demanding blacks, itís here. And then you can head across to Les Arcs and double your money (itís all on the Paradiski lift pass).

The choice: While Belle Plagne is one of the prettiest, handiest spots (in a great position for quick access to Les Arcs), you can holiday here half a dozen times and always see things from a different perspective.

The activities: Lots to embellish the skiing with. Try e-biking on fat tyres, heading across the snowy slopes trying to keep up with the guide (from Plagne Centre, from Ä69, elpro.fr) or zipwire down a snowy, forested cleft on the edge of Belle Plagne ñ eight zipwires up to 45m above the ground (elpro.fr).

The Colorado Park toboggan run is 1.5km of bends and tunnels (skipass-laplagne.com, Ä7). While other options include guided snowshoe hikes, dog-sledding And then thereís the bobsleigh, the track from the 1992 Winter Olympics ñ try the raft, a beginnersí one-man car (Ä45), reaching 80km/h through the 19 bends of the 1.5km run, or go for the big car with pro driver, reaching 120km/h.

The X Factor: A couple of hours at Belle Plagneís new Deep Nature spa, a world of relaxation hidden behind the rustic facades and bars. The contemporary interior is a contemporary dream in pale stone and wood, with several saunas, steam room and the futuristic salt cave. And indoor/outdoor pool and raised hot tubs have mountain views while glass-fronted timber barrel-like huts offer a place to lie back. A bigger, second pool with gushing water features is for families. Adults Ä32; family spa adults Ä19, under 15s Ä13.

Where to eat on the slopes
360: Everyone gets a view in this two-storey glass block, one floor jutting out over the slopes at the top of the Adrets chair above Montalbert. One level is an industrial chic cafeteria, all timber and steel, with pasta stations, rotisserie and a cauldron of soup, while above is a smart restaurant. Cool bar and a splendid terrace. le360-laplagne.fr

La Bergerie: A converted farm with a huge, bustling terrace that serves local dishes in a rustic atmosphere. It sits on the blue Mira run above Plagne Villages and is the place to stop for a tartiflette (the hearty cheesy potato dish) or simply a glass of vin chaud. It becomes an aprËs-ski haunt as the afternoon wears on, a DJ getting the dancing going. restaurant-la-plagne.com

Accommodation
Great value: Hotel Belle Plagne 2100 sits just above the main street, its pointy, glass-fronted centrepiece, housing cool, modern bar on one level, the light, airy restaurant (with gorgeous views over slope and mountains) above. Rooms are simple but the public areas are impressive. Buffet dinners always included a Raclette cheese browning under a heater (with all the trimmings), alongside pasta, meat and oven-baked fish whether salmon or something from a mountain lake. Friendly and multi-national ñ including a good crowd from Britainís Crystal.

Luxury: Hotel Carlina. Also in Belle Plagne, is one of the resortís finest, a boutique property with the air of a private chalet. Rooms, all with a balcony or terrace, face south over the slopes. Even family rooms, with a couple of single beds, are a contemporary delight. The adjoining Residence is five cool apartments for eight-12. Thereís a spa with a splendid indoor pool, a restaurant with four-course dinners (fondue on Sundays). Nice bar and sun terrace too.

One night special: The Over The Moon package is a night alone under the stars at 2,400m in a piste-groomer, its coach converted to a luxury caravan. It might be Ä320 for two, but you get transport breakfast, private bathroom in a nearby building ñ and, of course, wi-fi.

How to get to La Plagne


PACKAGE: Crystal Ski Holidays offers a week at Hotel Belle Plagne 2100 from £754pp, half board, when booked online (two sharing), including flights from Gatwick to Chambery and transfers. Direct flights available from all major UK airports. Crystal also offers seven nights at the Carlina, from £1,310pp, half-board.

"Itís a marvellous idea ñ six mountain huts have joined forces to create a seven day hiking tour, starting and ending in the village of Champoluc. Each night is spent in a different rifugio and the package includes dinner, prepared with local products, and DOC wines from the Aosta valley.

The route roughly follows a figure of eight, exploring three valleys, with marvellous views of the Italian Alps including the Matterhorn and the Monte Rosa range.

Matterhorn and Chamois
Matterhorn and Chamois
Leaving Turin, after crossing the flatlands, a tortuous drive through twisting hairpins, climbs to the village of Champoluc, in the upper reaches of the Ayas Valley. In earlier times this area was considered uninhabitable until it was populated by the Walser people, escaping poverty in Switzerland. These days itís a thriving resort with skiing in the winter and mountain biking and hiking in the summer.

Before I arrive, Iíve already downloaded the App from the website, which provides me with a GPS route, and at my hotel I get a map, a lightweight towel and sheet sleeping bag. Although there is an option to get your baggage transported, Iím going to be carry everything on my back, so Iíve reduced my load to the bare minimum. Iíve also decided, perhaps foolishly, to double up on a couple of stages, reasoning that I can easily manage seven hours of walking in a day.

Day 1: Champoluc to Rifugio Gran Tournalin 15km
Rifugio Ferraro
Rifugio Ferraro
The weather is clear and sunny as I set out, climbing up through the forest by a stream and waterfall. Itís fairly steep but Iím fresh and anxious to get on. This is one of those two stage days, so Iím anxious to get on. I reach the tiny Walser village of Mascognaz, nothing more than a few houses and a church, and follow the side of the Ayas valley to Rifugio Ferraro. This would be normally the end of the first stage, so I stop for a lunch of polenta and vegetables, washed down with a glass of beer.

Itís then a steep descent on a pleasant path to Saint-Jacques at the head of the valley, before climbing up through forest on the other side. Above the treeline at around 2000m, there are rumbles of thunder and it begins to hail.

This turns to light rain but I reach Rifugio Grand Tournalin at around five oíclock without getting really wet. As in all the huts, sleeping arrangements are in dormitories, but Iím relieved to be sharing with only one other. Thereís a hearty meal of minestrone, chicken with fried courgette and lashings of local red wine and Iím in bed by 10pm.

Day 2: Rifugio Grand Tournalin to Rifugio Ermitage 10km
After my double exertions yesterday, Iím only doing a single stage today so can take it easy. Weather is sunny as I climb up to the Col di Nana and am overtaken by a large group of Russian hikers, all carrying heavy packs. I leave mine at the Col to climb the Becca TrecarÈ, a pointed peak at 3000m and am joined at the summit by the Russians. Theyíre from the Moscow Club Alpino and give me some chocolate, telling me itís a tradition to share at the top.

Walser Houses

Thereís a decent path down to Cheneil, another attractive Walser village, popular for families and their dogs. After lunch, another slight uphill before dropping down to Chamois in the Valtournenche and the Rifugio Ermitage.

Here Iím delighted to be given a dormitory all to myself, and Antoine, the manager, plies me with large glasses of his draught beer. Heís excited that a group of women trail runners, including the local champion, will be also spending the night and I join them for dinner.

Day 3 Rifugio Ermitage to Rifugio Vieux Crest 15.5km
Ayas Valley
Ayas Valley
Unlike the trail runners who leave at 4am to catch the sunrise, I leave at 8am, prepared for a long day. Thereís been a thunderstorm during the night but it seems to have cleared. Iím crossing back to the Ayas Valley, so thereís a steep climb to Col Pillonet, but Iím rewarded with glorious views of the Matterhorn and the Monte Rosa range. Thereís a pleasant grassy track all the way down and I can see Champoluc below me.

Unfortunately Iím going to be hitting the valley lower down so itís a long hot descent to the Evancon River. Iím not particularly pleased to have to climb up again to Mascognaz, which I passed on the first day, but the walk follows a figure of eight and thereís no choice.

I arrive at Rifugio Vieux Crest parched, as Iíve run out of water, but thereís draft beer and a pleasant welcome from the Sara, the owner. Even better I get a room with toilet and shower and make full use of it. Food here is also good.

Day 4: Rifugio Vieux Crest to Rifugio Arp 16km
This is another day when Iím tackling two stages and the weather forecast is not good. I start as early as I can and meet many trail runners as I climb up to the Col Pinter.

Today Iím crossing to the Gressoney Valley and reach Rifugio Alpenz˘, just above, as the rain begins to start. Lunch is good with local cured Bresaola with grilled vegetables, then pasta carbonara, but outside itís stormy.

I don my waterproofs and set out along the side of the valley. The thunder is heavy and flashes of lightning illuminate the trees. Clouds obscure the mountains and I turn to climb steeply and am soon in the mist. Fortunately the path is well marked and, as I reach the Colle di Valnera, the rain stops and it begins to clear. Rifugio Arp is just below me and, since Iím completely soaked, Iím grateful for a hot stove to dry my clothes.

Day 5:  Rifugio Arp to Champoluc. 9.5km
I set out in thick mist but, as I start walking, it begins to clear. I pass several small lakes on my way up to the Colle di Palasinaz. I hear the whistles of Marmots, and startle a couple of Ibex.

Iím soon back down to the village of Mascognaz, for the third and last time. Back in Champoluc, even though Iíve been in the wilds for a few days, it feels strange to be back in civilisation.

Iíve been lucky ñ only a half day of rain and sun for the rest of the time, with glorious views from the tops. Itís a great hike that I can heartily recommend but just donít make the mistake of attempting two stages in one day.

"Did you ever step off a plane with wrinkled and stained clothes, a pore-clogged face, and a breath that tastes like bad airplane food? In that case, you know that maintaining travel hygiene while on the road isnít always easy. Especially when traveling in areas where access to basic amenities isnít available. However, if you prepare yourself properly, youíll always know how to find a way to maintain hygiene while you travel, whether youíre in a five-star hotel or trekking in the Amazon Jungle. Thatís what this article is about!

Some travelers donít go anywhere without a hand sanitizer and thereís a good reason for that. Itís common sense to sanitize your hands before eating street food when thereís no place to wash your hands but you should always carry a pocket sanitizer with you. Here are a couple of reasons. Firstly, when flying, you are 100 times more likely to catch a cold due to low humidity and one of the best ways to prevent this is to keep your hands clean. Additionally, when traveling in a new country that has a very different climate of what youíre used, youíll likely encounter a lot of germs that your body doesnít have an antidote for because it never had contact with such germs before. Obviously, you canít have complete control of this but keeping your hands clean and sanitized is critical to stopping nasty germs from spreading.

Maintain your facial hygiene while you travel
face wash

Even though not as important as keeping your hands clean, facial hygiene while traveling is also important. We all know dry skin can make you feel irritated or how sunburns can spoil your trip. If you want to avoid this and maintain your facial hygiene while you travel, you should consider two things.

The climate of the place youíre going to
Your skin type
If youíre traveling in hot and dry regions, like deserts, make sure to bring a moisturizer, a lip balm, and of course sunscreen. Alternatively, if youíre trekking in the jungle, you might not need a moisturizer because the area is already humid but you will surely need some sunscreen. If you want to save some space in your bag, Iíd suggest you go for a 2-in-1-solution (sunblock/moisturizer). Apart from this, itís probably a good idea to bring some rinse-free facial cleaner or at least some face-cleaning wipes.

Keep your breath fresh
bad breath




One of the most common consequences of racking up travel miles is getting whatís known as the travelerís breath. This happens because the production of saliva slows down for different reasons (not hydrating your body properly, low humidity, etc.) and allows bacteria to grow inside the mouth and develop bad breath. Additionally, many travelers skip their meals while traveling because they donít want to pay extra for a meal and this sometimes contributes to morning breath reoccurring later in the day too.

To avoid this, always carry some mints, gums or some fruits like apples and lemons. Additionally, you can get disposable Colgate wisps; tiny disposable toothbrushes that can help you freshen your breath when brushing your teeth isnít an option. Another solution I recently discovered are toothpaste PocketMistsñ a tiny container with an effect so powerful, it will make you feel the bacteria in your mouth being singed away.




Keep your body clean
shower nature




Sometimes while traveling, youíll be in an environment without access to clean water and shower facilities. If youíre planning to travel to such a destination, you can still maintain your body hygiene with no-rinse body wash. Itís the perfect solution for trekkers and campers who donít have access to clean water. These products utilize water-based odor neutralizer that doesnít require rinsing and is a great quick wash option.

How to clean your clothes on the road
laundry




When traveling, you need to be strategic about what kind of clothes you will pack and how will you clean and iron them. In order to do this, you first need to make a very specific plan of the places you will visit and the terrain you will explore. Are you planning to move a lot and spend a lot of time in the outdoors? Pack some light-weight, wrinkle-free clothes that dry quickly. If you want to keep your clothes clean while exploring the outdoors, consider buying a pocket-size portable laundry bag that will help you keep your clothes clean. If you donít have an iron but want to keep your clothes tidy, get a wrinkle releaser; a liquid product that helps straighten your crumbled clothes and stretch it out. Finally, if youíre planning to spend a lot of time in the outdoors, donít forget to bring a waterproof jacket.

Cleaning the place you stay in
Some people leave their rented room neat and clean while others leave it dirty and messy. Inevitably, someone always shows up to clean after you, but does that mean you can leave everything a mess? Arguably, you should do as much as you can. Itís not a rule, but itís seen as a friendly and polite thing to do. Max Kenyon from cleanthatfloor.com says itís a matter of your manners and politeness, so you might want to consider how you leave the accommodation. Generally speaking, you should behave as you would if you were a guest in someoneís home. This means not leaving broken glass and trash behind you. Itís basic courtesy to try and make it easier for the person who has to clean after you.

Make your bed
travel hygiene




Making the bed or stripping the sheets before you leave says a lot about you as a person. Frequently, people tend to forget their stuff in bed. Things like books, clothes, hair clips, and other such items are often found once you turn the sheets to fold them. Itís not something youíre required to do. Still, youíd probably fold the blanket and put the pillows back in place if you were staying in someoneís house.

Wash the dishes
You probably have a kitchen if you rented an apartment for a few days or weeks. If you used the plates, it would be nice to wash them before leaving the place. Again, if you donít do it, the house cleaning service will do it for you since they have to make the place ready for the next guest. However, if you wish to make it a bit easier to that someone, you should wash your coffee mug before storming out. Much like when it comes to your bed, washing dishes is basic courtesy and politeness. It takes you no more than a minute or two, and it can make a massive difference to the person cleaning after you.




Take the trash out
This isnít something people usually do. You should do it if you can, but if not, you can at least throw it all in the bin. Donít leave food packaging and whatnot all over the room. Make sure to pick up all the trash and throw it in the bin, so itís easier for the house cleaning service to throw it away.

As we mentioned, youíre not obligated to clean when staying at a hotel. However, itís good manners and often considered polite to do so regardless of how long you stayed.

Menstruation hygiene tips

If youíre a girl traveling for a longer period, you might be unfortunate your period on the road. This is never easy but there are a few basic tips you can follow. For starters, always carry a supply of clean pads or tampons, especially if traveling to a rural area and make sure you keep it in a dry place. Donít forget to change your tampon/pad every 6-7 hours when youíre physically active and moving a lot. Also, make sure you have enough cleaning supplies; toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning wipes, and a bottle of antibacterial liquid. When youíre in the outdoors and are not prepared for your monthly cycle, you can use smooth stones, moss, or twigs, as long as theyíre not prickly.

Last but not least, donít forget your painkillers and PMS medication and consider getting a reusable menstrual cup but make sure that it isnít too small if you have a heavy flow; these products come in different sizes. Finally, donít forget that this cup needs to be kept clean all the time and this is not possible if you donít have access to a supply of clean water.

How to pack light with all these travel hygiene items?
travel hygiene handbag




While you might think that you need to pack a lot of items in order to be able to maintain personal hygiene while you travel but there certainly are some tricks in which you can cut back. Personally, I always stick to the 3:1:1 rule. What does this mean?

3 stands for 3-ounce containers or smaller, 1 stands for one quart-sized plastic bag, and the other 1 stands for one bag per passenger. All the containers must fit inside your bag and you only carry one such bag.




Feeling Dirty?
If you ever feel that you donít have enough time to wash your clothes or maintain your personal hygiene while you travel, slow down. Stop for a few days, take your time, relax and refresh, get a long shower, and clean your clothes. Youíll feel much better. And also, donít forget that as important personal hygiene is, your physical condition and mental well-being are just as important and your travel adventures will feel a lot more rewarding if you give yourself a break once in a while. Take some vitamins, eat as healthy as you can, and donít forget to exercise when possible. Your body and mind will be grateful."
"New York on wheels may put your head in a spin ñ from the traffic jams to the busy subway, commuting in the city is far from a relaxing journey. That was my mind-set before our latest visit to the Big Apple, when I discovered the two-wheeled kind was in fact not only a great way to explore my surroundings, but travelling on bike also gave me a different perspective of this incredible city.

Bike tours are a great way of touring a city
Iíve done bike tours in Paris and Barcelona ñ but I couldnít imagine it would be enjoyable in New York where the hustle and bustle of the city is all encompassing. How wrong I was! Admittedly, it wasnít a ride across Times Square or even down Fifth Avenue that I was attempting but a tour of Central Park ñ which may sound slightly less hectic. Even so, with hundreds of things to do in the park and a reported 40 million visitors a year, it is still buzzing with activity.

Central Park is dubbed New York Cityís playground
It is no wonder that the iconic park is referred to as New York Cityís playground ñ the vast green space is one of the top New York attractions for locals and tourists and is the equivalent size of 650 football fields.

This may sound somewhat intimidating ñ especially for someone like me who is a fair-weather cyclist ñ but the promise of a tour that brings alive the parkís history and provides a chance to view famous Manhattan landmarks without queues or the endless throng of tourists was enough to convince me (although the opportunity to try to offset the pile of waffles and the milkshake Iíd consumed for breakfast through a two hour bike ride might also have had something to do with it.)

Before contemplating what lay ahead I needed a guiding hand and that came in the form of Jennifer, our guide from Unlimited Biking, one of several bike companies that had come highly recommended to me.

I arrived at the bike shop ñ situated five minutes from the park- in a state of anxiety. It was chilly and the last time Iíd ridden a bike had resulted in a very prickly situation; me tipping the baby basket (and said third child) into a thorn bush. However, it didnít take long for Jennifer to calm my nerves; in fact her boundless energy and enthusiasm helped fuel my adrenalin.

After all, it wasnít every day I took a bike ride without the kids in one of the most beautiful parks in the world. In fact, despite the unusually chilly conditions ñ seeing the park covered in orange and red hued leaves added to its beauty.

Central Park in NewYork by bike c Kelly Kopp
Central Park in New York by bike c Kelly Kopp
The first thing to remember when taking a bike tour of Central Park we learn is not to offend the joggers.

Stick to the cycle lanes, stay out of their paths and keep your eyes ahead of you. That part was only too obvious I thought until I realised with the skyscrapers looming ahead of just how easy it was to lose concentration ñ everyone stops to stare.


Central Park in New York by bike c Kelly Kopp
Contrary to how it looks, cycling around the park is no mean feat. It is full of steep hills and windy roads so you need to be prepared for some pedal power to get through it, to be rewarded with some of the best views and sights of the city.

Times Square, Manhattanís most chaotic site, is just a few blocks away, yet on the cycle path itís so silent, so un-New York that it feels rather tranquil. And Iím actually learning something. Not so much about cycling uphill ñ which Iím slowly getting the hang of ñ but about the city.

Secret sites of Central Park
My past visits to New York have been a blur of shopping and eating, but today Jen is pointing out sites I never knew existed. Thereís the vast buildings that home some of New Yorkís wealthiest residents, intricate carvings and statues around the park and even benches which can be adopted with a donation of $10,000.

Bethesda and fountain Central Park
Bethesda and fountain in Central Park, New York
And then there is the famous Bethesda terrace and fountain which have been featured in many a film, the parks reservoir ñ where we learn about New Yorkís water system and the running track where President Clinton and Madonna have been known to run.

Strawberry Fields
With our last stop on the bike ride being the infamous Strawberry fields ñ the 2.5 acre landscaped section of park named after the Beatles song- Jen points out the nearby block where John Lennon lived and lets us into a story about how Yoko Ono is often spotted in the park getting some fresh air.

With plenty of time to soak up our surroundings, rest breaks and photo opportunities ñ this bike ride is certainly one that will take you to the core of the Big Apple!

"How to choose the right travel insurance
When you travel outside your country, there’s always a probability of things going wrong. More often than not, you probably won’t need travel insurance but you definitely shouldn’t travel without one. Between 25% and 35% of people today travel without travel insurance but yet one travel insurance claim is made every minute. Even I’m guilty of traveling without travel insurance on most of my trips but the mishaps that happened to me throughout my travels have changed my mind about travel insurance. Travel is expensive enough as it is but it can get even more expensive when things you can’t control go wrong. Insurance can offer compensation when your luggage gets stolen or damaged, when your flight is canceled or even when you have a medical emergency. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution and you should know how to choose the right travel insurance for your circumstances.

How to choose the right travel insurance? Learn the basics
how to choose the right travel insurance

First, make sure what kind of medical insurance you need and what kind of medical insurance your package offers. Then, make sure your travel insurance will protect you from loss or damage of luggage and personal items by offering reasonable compensation in these situations. Also, make sure to see and compare different online travel insurance quotes and check the limit for a claim on individual items. Some insurance companies offer a very low price. Just make sure you know this before signing anything.

Next, you should also understand excess and know that the cheaper the policy, the higher the excess will be. What does this mean? Excess is the amount that you would have to pay if something undesirable happens. For example, if something happens to you on your vacation and your excess fee is $100 but the medical bill is $1,000, you are responsible for paying $100 while the rest will be paid by the insurer. So, when you go for a cheaper policy, the excess will usually be higher.

And last but not least, make sure to read the cancellation policy. The majority of insurance claims happen because of cancellations. Compare the amount you pay for your holiday to the policy and always make sure that the policy compensation will be higher than the amount you will spend on your vacation. Also, make sure the policy includes the cost of getting you home if you miss a flight connection because of an unexpected delay.

Who all is going?
family travel




If you’re traveling with family or friend, you can choose different family packages, such as single-parent family cover, couple travel insurance (if you and your partner share an address), family holiday insurance (for two parents and children who are 18 or younger), couple and child cover (suitable if you have one child). However, be careful that your family policy might not be applicable if your children are traveling with someone who’s not mentioned on the policy. The family policy also might not include stepchildren or children who don’t live with the policyholder.

Annual insurance vs single trip
If you are traveling at least three times in a calendar year or traveling indefinitely, buying an annual insurance policy makes perfect sense mathematically. When you travel more often and longer, the probability that something will go wrong gets higher. However, make sure that you check the maximum number of days covered for each trip; many insurers limit the number of days to 20 or 21. If you’re backpacking, choose a specific backpacker travel insurance policy.

Make sure your destination is covered
destination




Different insurers from different regions include different countries in their worldwide policies. For example, if you’re from the US, most insurers include Caribbean countries in their packages but that doesn’t apply to Central Asian countries. This is something you have to know before you choose the right travel insurance.

Protect yourself against default
Even though it doesn’t happen very often, when it happens this can definitely ruin your vacation. 2019 was the year that saw two giants like Thomas Cook and Jet Airways and apparently, it’s better to be safe than sorry when traveling abroad.

Know what your plan doesn’t cover
Travel accidents




If you plan to rent a car or bike during your vacation, make sure your travel insurance covers this. The same goes for all other activities. If you’re planning to go kitesurfing, bungee jumping or paragliding, make sure to check if these activities are covered by your plan. Most insurance companies include them because the risk of injury related to these activities is very low. However, if you’re planning to go skiing or horse riding, some insurers might not include these activities by default because the risk of injury is higher.

Additionally, don’t expect travel insurance to cover the same things as standard medical insurance. Most travel insurance packages are there to protect you from unexpected events that can cost a lot of money if they were to happen.

Choose the right coverage amount
A lot of cheaper travel insurance plans don’t offer high coverage amounts. Most packages offer between $10,000 and $50,000 in medical coverage. However, in some parts of the world, a broken bone and an ambulance ride or an emergency transfer home can cost more than that. Just to be sure, I personally always try to go with at least $100,000 worth of coverage, especially when traveling in developed countries.




Don’t wait too long
wait too long




Most insurance companies require buyers to purchase an insurance plan near the time you booked your flight. If you wait too long, some insurance companies might not cover your plan.

Check your credit cards
credit cards




Some credit cards might offer insurance benefits in case your trip was canceled, your rental car was damaged or you lost your passport, luggage or other personal belongings. Make sure to read the fine print and if necessary, contact your bank for more information. Also to be sure, obtain written confirmation of the insurance and who to contact if an emergency occurs. However, keep in mind that most credit cards don’t provide medical/evacuation coverage and they have a lot of restrictions on what is covered.

Cancellation conditions
cancellation




As mentioned above, you should make sure that the premium would cover all cancellation costs. However, you should also check when cancellation is applicable. Most insurers offer cancellation that includes a close relative passing away or falling ill, getting quarantined, getting sick, being made redundant, getting called up for jury service or as a witness, if your leave is canceled, you’re requested to stay home or return to your country by the policy or if there’s an epidemic in the country you’re traveling to.

However, there are a few things you should be careful about. Most insurers don’t define cousins, uncles, and aunts as close relatives. If a close relative falls ill, you won’t be covered if your relative had a medical condition before you purchased your insurance plan.

Check out the pay-out time
Make sure to see how much time it will take the insurer to pay out your plan in case of an accident. Also, check whether the contract requires that you submit a report of the incident and if so, in how much time? Finally, check what all supporting documents (if any) you need to attach to your claim. Talking about documents, here are a few useful tips for making a travel insurance claim.

Document, document, document
how to choose the right travel insurance plan




When it comes to making a claim, you can never have enough paperwork. Document everything you might use as proof if something goes wrong. This will make getting a payout on your claim much easier and a lot faster.

Click pictures of your things
Especially things which are expensive. You never know whether something will get damaged after a flight or a long bus journey. Make sure to have ‘before’ pictures that will proof ‘the after’ picture happened during the trip.

Keep copies of everything

Summer may be loosing its bloom but as it does so Autumn brings itís own natural palette to Britainís forests, arboretums, parks and gardens.

From late September and throughout October itís all abut fiery reds, golden yellows and rich burgundies of turning leaves. Here are ten places to relax and enjoy Britainís autumnal beauty at its best.

1Faskally Wood, Perthshire, Scotland

Perthshire is known as big tree country, with around 25 species of tree including Scots pine, silver birch, hazel, ash and oak. While itís a beautiful place to visit year-round, Faskally Wood really delivers the goods when it comes to autumnal displays.

Created as a ìmodel forestî in the 19th century, itís full of beautiful specimens which are pointed out on the guided trail-blaze walk in October. As night falls, the wood transforms into the Enchanted Forest with a shimmering light and music show.



2Lime Avenue at Marbury Country Park, Cheshire, north-west England

Instagram at the ready! Capture the blonde autumn tints of magnificently symmetrical Lime Avenue ñ a legacy of Marbury Country Parkës former grand estate days. The park is in the heart of Northwich Community Woodlands, which is part of the Mersey Forest.



3New Forest, Hampshire, southern England

New Forest National Parkís ancient woodlands cover more than 50 square miles. Discover mighty redwoods planted in the late 1850s, as well as alder, beech, sweet chestnut and other varieties. Take the tall trees trail under majestic conifers on Rhinefield Ornamental Drive ñ itís one of the best places to experience the vivid array of autumnal hues, which arrive in time for New Forest Walking Festival in October.

Donít miss the huge 500 year-old Knightwood Oak on the Bolderwood Ornamental Drive near Lyndhurst, and look out for the parkís famous wild ponies, as well as pigs roaming the forest floor on the hunt for green acorns.



4Richmond Park, London, England
Escape the city and soak up the rich colours of autumn with a walk or cycle around Richmond Park, when the leaves of the parkís ancient oak trees are tinted a deep orange. Itís a national nature reserve, the largest of Londonís royal parks, and three times the size of New Yorkís Central Park. Youíll most likely enjoy some wildlife spotting among the autumn leaves ñ Richmond Park has been a deer park since 1637, and is populated with 630 freely-roaming red and fallow deer.



5Bodnant Gardens, Colwyn Bay, Wales
Set in a stunning location overlooking Snowdoniaís Carneddau mountains, highlights of Bodnantís woodland garden include striking sweet chestnut trees, a waterfall, and a deep valley framed by towering trees. October is the peak time to enjoy the seasonís shades, celebrated on an autumn colour walk with Bodnant Gardenís resident expert.



6Bedgebury National Pinetum and Forest, Kent, south-east England
Known as ìThe Garden of Englandî Kent is where you can find one of worldís finest coniferous tree collections at Bedgebury National Pinetum and Forest.

Most of these species have been introduced from all over the world ñ on a walk through the forest youíll find pines from California, Scotland and even Taiwan. During the autumn months, orange, red, purple and yellow leaves decorate the canopies and forest floor. If a footpath isnít exciting enough, at Go Ape Bedgebury Forest adventurers can zip-line, balance and scramble their way through the tree tops instead.



7Mount Stewart House, County Down, Northern Ireland
This stately home is framed by one of the National Trustís most unusual gardens. The warm climate of the surrounding Strangford Lough (a large sea lake) supports exotic plants, which has led to parts of the landscaped gardens taking inspiration from the Mediterranean. In October, Mount Stewartís guides take visitors on an autumn walk around the gardenís rusty hues.



8Stourhead, Wiltshire, south-west England

Stourheadís world-famous 18th-century landscaped gardens ñ featuring classical temples, a lake, and a domed ëgrottoí ñ were described as ëa living work of artí when they first opened in the 1740s. The original gardeners planted sycamore, oak, beech, and Spanish chestnut trees, followed by birch, horse chestnut and ash, added a generation later alongside more exotic trees and shrubs. The trees reflecting in the lake in all their golden glory is a sight to behold, and a highlight of the free autumn colour guided garden tours in October.



9Kew Gardens, London, England
Kew Gardens is just 20 minutes from the city centre yet you can see some of the worldís rarest plants. There are guided autumn walks and tree identification sessions around the enormous 300-acre site. Or take to the Treetop Walkway up in the canopy 18 metres above the woodland floor for great views across the gardens and the city beyond.



10Westonbirt National Arboretum, Gloucestershire, south-west England

Carefully planted in the mid-19th century, Westonbirt National Arboretum is home to around 15,000 specimens from all over the globe. This peaceful oasis bursts with autumnal colours from late September to November, but October is arguably the best time to visit, when the Japanese maples are at their peak. There are 17 miles of paths across the 600-acre site, which is divided into three main areas: the Old Arboretum, the ancient woodland of Silk Wood, and the Downs grassland.

"Holiday Park Review: Hoburne Devon Bay, Paignton, Devon, UK
Hoburne Devon Bay Holiday Park is a no-frills, one-stop-shop of a caravan park set high above the bay at Goodrington Sands

By Richard Burton -Sep 4, 2019

 Share

A short but sweeping drive takes you from a white-walled housing estate on to an even bigger sprawl in which static caravans almost seamlessly replace bricks and mortar. Itís high up with views across a valley and out to a sea that laps one corner of the English Riviera.  

Itís where youíll find families dressed for the pool ambling along tree-lined roads with inflatables and Disney-style characters teaching the kids how to dance.

Itís one where youíll find a young, enthusiastic staff going out of their way to make you feel at home during the day and security guards on the door on a Saturday night when the ballroom is packed, the music ramps up and theyíre three-deep at the bar. 

Welcome to Hoburne Devon, a 300-unit static caravan park on a sun-trap of a hillside overlooking Goodrington Sands in Paignton, a place to which thousands flock, where the camp spirit lives on and everyone, it seems, is game for a laugh.

Who for?
Hoburne Devon Bay 
Hoburne Devon Bay caravans are chalet style, comfortably set apart from each other with handy parking bays  
Families on a budget. Anyone who likes their holidays served as a Full English; unfussy bars, pools, one-armed bandits and an entertainment schedule that includes the likes of ìan evening with Barry from EastEndersî.

Accommodation



The only caravan viewed was the top-end Platinum Plus which was clean, smart and had more of a chalet feel in a pre-fab sort of way.

Two chunky sofas, a flat-screen TV (and one in the main bedroom) and a kitchen/diner with a fridge/freezer and as much storage space as youíd find in a decent modern apartment.

There was a wrap-around balcony accessed via French doors that clipped neatly back, adding to the welcome roominess and making you forget youíre wrapped in squeaky, creaky uPVC.

Thereís also bags of parking with bays everywhere and, while the layout does feel a little dense and barracks-like ñ donít look from the air ñ thereís enough fresh air between caravans to be friendly but not intrusive.   

Food and drink

Hoburne Devon Bay: the food was nutritious, family-oriented and traditional holiday fare
Traditional, hearty and well-presented English fare in the bars and thereís a Nisa Local on site for groceries, which was fine for staple essentials but little else which was disappointing given the self-catering ethos.

Frozen chips, fish fingers, processed meats and lots of tins sat alongside shelves of cheap toys which include dubious toilet games such as ìPoop Hoopî and a ìFish for Floaters Gamesî.

Facilities
Hoburne Devon Bay pool
Hoburne Devon Bay: The indoor pool is safe for younger children, well-policed by staff and boasting a giant flume
Quite a lot, to be fair. A central complex behind the main reception houses everything from bars, lounges, indoor and outdoor playgrounds and pools watched by lifeguards. The outside one is vividly blue, flanked by beach huts and loungers while the inside one, popular and safe for younger children at just over 3ft deep, has a decent flume and a whirlpool bath, although its jets do little more than tickle.   

Thereís a small gaming area featuring arcade machines such as simulator rides, a shoot-em-up and a claw that grabs furry animals and never disappoints. Oh, and a small gym, a golf course, sports pitch and even laundrette up the hill behind the shop.

Is Wi-Fi available?
Only just. It took five attempts to connect and would disconnect regularly and seemingly at random, although reconnection was pretty instant after that. No problem with a phone connection via Vodafone.
